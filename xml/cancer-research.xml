  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Louis DeRidder was 12 years old, he had a medical emergency that nearly cost him his life. The terrifying experience gave him a close-up look at medical care and made him eager to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can’t always pinpoint exactly what gets you interested in something, but that was a transformative moment,” says DeRidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school, he grabbed the chance to participate in a medicine-focused program, spending about half of his days during his senior year in high school learning about medical science and shadowing doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRidder was hooked. He became fascinated by the technologies that make treatments possible and was particularly interested in how drugs are delivered to the brain, a curiosity that sparked a lifelong passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here I was, a 17-year-old in high school, and a decade later, that problem still fascinates me,” he says. “That’s what eventually got me into the drug delivery field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRidder’s interests led him to transfer half-way through his undergraduate studies to Johns Hopkins University, where he performed research he had proposed in a Goldwater Scholarship proposal. The research focused on the development of a nanoparticle-drug conjugate to deliver a drug to brain cells in order to transform them from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Such a technology could be valuable in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, DeRidder entered the joint Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, where he has embarked on a somewhat different type of drug delivery project — developing a device that measures the concentration of a chemotherapy drug in the blood while it is being administered and adjusts the infusion rate so the concentration is optimal for the patient. The system is known as CLAUDIA, or Closed-Loop AUtomated Drug Infusion RegulAtor, and can allow for the personalization of drug dosing for a variety of different drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project stemmed from discussions with his faculty advisors — Robert Langer, the David H. Koch Institute Professor, and Giovanni Traverso, the Karl Van Tassel Career Development Professor and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. They explained to him that chemotherapy dosing is based on a formula developed in 1916 that estimates a patient’s body surface area. The formula doesn’t consider important influences such as differences in body composition and metabolism, or circadian fluctuations that can affect how a drug interacts with a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once my advisors presented the reality of how chemotherapies are dosed,” DeRidder says, “I thought, ‘This is insane. How is this the clinical reality?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his advisors agreed this was a great project for his PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After they gave me the problem statement, we began to brainstorm ways that we could develop a medical device to improve the lives of patients” DeRidder says, adding, “I love starting with a blank piece of paper and then brainstorming to work out the best solution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost from the start, DeRidder’s research process involved MATLAB and Simulink, developed by the mathematical computer software company MathWorks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MathWorks and Simulink are key to what we do,” DeRidder says. “They enable us to model the drug pharmacokinetics — how the body distributes and metabolizes the drug. We also model the components of our system with their software. That was especially critical for us in the very early days, because it let us know whether it was even possible to control the concentration of the drug. And since then, we’ve continuously improved the control algorithm, using these simulations. You simulate hundreds of different experiments before performing any experiments in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his innovative use of the MATLAB and Simulink tools, DeRidder was awarded MathWorks fellowships both last year and this year. He has also received a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fellowships have been critical to our development of the CLAUDIA drug-delivery system,” DeRidder says, adding that he has “had the pleasure of working with a great team of students and researchers in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he would like to move CLAUDIA toward clinical use, where he thinks it could have significant impact. “Whatever I can do to help push it toward the clinic, including potentially helping to start a company to help commercialize the system, I’m definitely interested in doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing CLAUDIA, DeRidder is working on developing new nanoparticles to deliver therapeutic nucleic acids. The project involves synthesizing new nucleic acid molecules, as well as developing the new polymeric and lipid nanoparticles to deliver the nucleic acids to targeted tissue and cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DeRidder says he likes working on technologies at different scales, from medical devices to molecules — all with the potential to improve the practice of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, he finds time in his busy schedule to do community service. For the past three years, he has spent time helping the homeless on Boston streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s easy to lose track of the concrete, simple ways that we can serve our communities when we’re doing research,” DeRidder says, “which is why I have often sought out ways to serve people I come across every day, whether it is a student I mentor in lab, serving the homeless, or helping out the stranger you meet in the store who is having a bad day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, DeRidder says, he’ll head back to work that also recalls his early exposure to the medical field in high school, where he interacted with a lot of people with different types of dementia and other neurological diseases at a local nursing home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My long-term plan includes working on developing devices and molecular therapies to treat neurological diseases, in addition to continuing to work on cancer,” he says. “Really, I’d say that early experience had a big impact on me.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of all cancer patients in the United States receive radiation therapy as part of their treatment. However, this radiation can have severe side effects that often end up being too difficult for patients to tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from a tiny organism that can withstand huge amounts of radiation, researchers at MIT, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the University of Iowa have developed a new strategy that may protect patients from this kind of damage. Their approach makes use of a protein from tardigrades, often also called “water bears,” which are usually less than a millimeter in length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers injected messenger RNA encoding this protein into mice, they found that it generated enough protein to protect cells’ DNA from radiation-induced damage. If developed for use in humans, this approach could benefit many cancer patients, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Radiation can be very helpful for many tumors, but we also recognize that the side effects can be limiting. There’s an unmet need with respect to helping patients mitigate the risk of damaging adjacent tissue,” says Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traverso and James Byrne, an assistant professor of radiation oncology at the University of Iowa, are the senior authors of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01360-5" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are Ameya Kirtane, an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a visiting scientist at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and Jianling Bi, a research scientist at the University of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extreme survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiation is often used to treat cancers of the head and neck, where it can damage the mouth or throat, making it very painful to eat or drink. It is also commonly used for gastrointestinal cancers, which can lead to rectal bleeding. Many patients end up delaying treatments or stopping them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This affects a huge number of patients, and it can manifest as something as simple as mouth sores, which can limit a person’s ability to eat because it’s so painful, to requiring hospitalization because people are suffering so terribly from the pain, weight loss, or bleeding. It can be pretty dangerous, and it’s something that we really wanted to try and address,” Byrne says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are very few ways to prevent radiation damage in cancer patients. There are a handful of drugs that can be given to try to reduce the damage, and for prostate cancer patients, a hydrogel can be used to create a physical barrier between the prostate and the rectum during radiation treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years, Traverso and Byrne have been working on developing new ways to prevent radiation damage. In the new study, they were inspired by the extraordinary survival ability of tardigrades. Found all over the world, usually in aquatic environments, these organisms are well known for their resilience to extreme conditions. Scientists have even sent them into space, where they were shown to survive extreme dehydration and cosmic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key component of tardigrades’ defense systems is a unique damage suppressor protein called Dsup, which binds to DNA and helps protect it from radiation-induced damage. This protein plays a major role in tardigrades’ ability to survive radiation doses 2,000 to 3,000 times higher than what a human being can tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brainstorming ideas for novel ways to protect cancer patients from radiation, the researchers wondered if they might be able to deliver messenger RNA encoding Dsup to patient tissues before radiation treatment. This mRNA would trigger cells to transiently express the protein, protecting DNA during the treatment. After a few hours, the mRNA and protein would disappear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this to work, the researchers needed a way to deliver mRNA that would generate large amounts of protein in the target tissues. They screened libraries of delivery particles containing both polymer and lipid components, which have been used separately to achieve efficient mRNA delivery. From these screens, they identified one polymer-lipid particle that was best-suited for delivery to the colon, and another that was optimized to deliver mRNA to mouth tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought that perhaps by combining these two systems — polymers and lipids — we may be able to get the best of both worlds and get highly potent RNA delivery. And that’s essentially what we saw,” Kirtane says. “One of the strengths of our approach is that we are using a messenger RNA, which just temporarily expresses the protein, so it’s considered far safer than something like DNA, which may be incorporated into the cells’ genome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection from radiation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After showing that these particles could successfully deliver mRNA to cells grown in the lab, the researchers tested whether this approach could effectively protect tissue from radiation in a mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They injected the particles into either the cheek or the rectum several hours before giving a dose of radiation similar to what cancer patients would receive. In these mice, the researchers saw a 50 percent reduction in the amount of double-stranded DNA breaks caused by radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows great promise and is a really novel idea leveraging natural mechanisms of protection again DNA damage for the purpose of protecting healthy cells during radiation treatments for cancer,” says Ben Ho Park, director of the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that the protective effect of the Dsup protein did not spread beyond the injection site, which is important because they don’t want to protect the tumor itself from the effects of radiation. To make this treatment more feasible for potential use in humans, the researchers now plan to work on developing a version of the Dsup protein that would not provoke an immune response, as the original tardigrade protein likely would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If developed for use in humans, this protein could also potentially be used to protect against DNA damage caused by chemotherapy drugs, the researchers say. Another possible application would be to help prevent radiation damage in astronauts in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors of the paper include Netra Rajesh, Chaoyang Tang, Miguel Jimenez, Emily Witt, Megan McGovern, Arielle Cafi, Samual Hatfield, Lauren Rosenstock, Sarah Becker, Nicole Machado, Veena Venkatachalam, Dylan Freitas, Xisha Huang, Alvin Chan, Aaron Lopes, Hyunjoon Kim, Nayoon Kim, Joy Collins, Michelle Howard, Srija Manchkanti, and Theodore Hong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Prostate Cancer Foundation Young Investigator Award, the U.S. Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Program Early Investigator Award, a Hope Funds for Cancer Research Fellowship, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, and the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Helping the immune system attack tumors</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Stefani Spranger is working to discover why some cancers don’t respond to immunotherapy, in hopes of making them more vulnerable to it.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In addition to patrolling the body for foreign invaders, the immune system also hunts down and destroys cells that have become cancerous or precancerous. However, some cancer cells end up evading this surveillance and growing into tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once established, tumor cells often send out immunosuppressive signals, which leads T cells to become “exhausted” and unable to attack the tumor. In recent years, some cancer immunotherapy drugs have shown great success in rejuvenating those T cells so they can begin attacking tumors again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this approach has proven effective against cancers such as melanoma, it doesn’t work as well for others, including lung and ovarian cancer. MIT Associate Professor Stefani Spranger is trying to figure out how those tumors are able to suppress immune responses, in hopes of finding new ways to galvanize T cells into attacking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really want to understand why our immune system fails to recognize cancer,” Spranger says. “And I’m most excited about the really hard-to-treat cancers because I think that’s where we can make the biggest leaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work has led to a better understanding of the factors that control T-cell responses to tumors, and raised the possibility of improving those responses through vaccination or treatment with immune-stimulating molecules called cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re working on understanding what exactly the problem is, and then collaborating with engineers to find a good solution,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jumpstarting T cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a student in Germany, where students often have to choose their college major while still in high school, Spranger envisioned going into the pharmaceutical industry and chose to major in biology. At Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, her course of study began with classical biology subjects such as botany and zoology, and she began to doubt her choice. But, once she began taking courses in cell biology and immunology, her interest was revived and she continued into a biology graduate program at the university.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a paper discussion class early in her graduate school program, Spranger was assigned to a &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; paper on a promising new immunotherapy treatment for melanoma. This strategy involves isolating tumor-infiltrating T-cells during surgery, growing them into large numbers, and then returning them to the patient. For more than 50 percent of those patients, the tumors were completely eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To me, that changed the world,” Spranger recalls. “You can take the patient’s own immune system, not really do all that much to it, and then the cancer goes away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spranger completed her PhD studies in a lab that worked on further developing that approach, known as adoptive T-cell transfer therapy. At that point, she still was leaning toward going into pharma, but after finishing her PhD in 2011, her husband, also a biologist, convinced her that they should both apply for postdoc positions in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ended up at the University of Chicago, where Spranger worked in a lab that studies how the immune system responds to tumors. There, she discovered that while melanoma is usually very responsive to immunotherapy, there is a small fraction of melanoma patients whose T cells don’t respond to the therapy at all. That got her interested in trying to figure out why the immune system doesn’t always respond to cancer the way that it should, and in finding ways to jumpstart it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her postdoc, Spranger also discovered that she enjoyed mentoring students, which she hadn’t done as a graduate student in Germany. That experience drew her away from going into the pharmaceutical industry, in favor of a career in academia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had my first mentoring teaching experience having an undergrad in the lab, and seeing that person grow as a scientist, from barely asking questions to running full experiments and coming up with hypotheses, changed how I approached science and my view of what academia should be for,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When applying for faculty jobs, Spranger was drawn to MIT by the collaborative environment of MIT and its Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, which offered the chance to collaborate with a large community of engineers who work in the field of immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That community is so vibrant, and it’s amazing to be a part of it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the research she had done as a postdoc, Spranger wanted to explore why some tumors respond well to immunotherapy, while others do not. For many of her early studies, she used a mouse model of non-small-cell lung cancer. In human patients, the majority of these tumors do not respond well to immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We build model systems that resemble each of the different subsets of non-responsive non-small cell lung cancer, and we’re trying to really drill down to the mechanism of why the immune system is not appropriately responding,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of that work, she has investigated why the immune system behaves differently in different types of tissue. While immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can stimulate a strong T-cell response in the skin, they don’t do nearly as much in the lung. However, Spranger has shown that T cell responses in the lung can be improved when immune molecules called cytokines are also given along with the checkpoint inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those cytokines work, in part, by activating dendritic cells — a class of immune cells that help to initiate immune responses, including activation of T cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dendritic cells are the conductor for the orchestra of all the T cells, although they’re a very sparse cell population,” Spranger says. “They can communicate which type of danger they sense from stressed cells and then instruct the T cells on what they have to do and where they have to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spranger’s lab is now beginning to study other types of tumors that don’t respond at all to immunotherapy, including ovarian cancer and glioblastoma. Both the brain and the peritoneal cavity appear to suppress T-cell responses to tumors, and Spranger hopes to figure out how to overcome that immunosuppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re specifically focusing on ovarian cancer and glioblastoma, because nothing’s working right now for those cancers,” she says. “We want to understand what we have to do in those sites to induce a really good anti-tumor immune response.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“There is no treatment available for your son. We can’t do anything to help him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Fernando Goldsztein MBA ’03 heard those words, something inside him snapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I refused to accept what the doctors were saying. I transformed my fear into my greatest strength and started fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldsztein’s 12-year-old son Frederico was diagnosed with relapsing medulloblastoma, a life-threatening pediatric brain tumor. Goldsztein's life — and career plan — changed in an instant. He had to learn to become a different kind of leader altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldsztein never set out to become a founder, the &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/a&gt; taught him the importance of networking, building friendships, and making career connections with peers and faculty from all walks of life. He began using those skills in a new way — boldly reaching out to the top medulloblastoma doctors and scientists at hospitals around the world to ask for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew that I had to do something to save Frederico, but also the other estimated 15,000 children diagnosed with the disease around the world each year,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Goldsztein launched &lt;a href="https://mbinitiative.org/en/" target="_blank"&gt;The Medulloblastoma Initiative (MBI)&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization dedicated to finding a cure using a remarkable new model for funding rare disease research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just 18 months, the organization — which is still in startup mode — has raised $11 million in private funding and brought together 14 of the world’s most prestigious labs and hospitals from across North America, Europe, and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two promising trials will launch in the coming months, and three additional trials are in the pipeline and currently awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this in an industry that is notorious for bureaucratic red tape, and where the timeline from an initial lab discovery to a patient receiving a first treatment averages seven to 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While government research grants typically allocate just 4 cents on the dollar toward pediatric cancer research — pennies doled out across multiple labs pursuing uncoordinated efforts — MBI is laser-focused on pushing 100 percent of their funding toward a singular goal, without any overhead or administrative costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no time to lose,” Goldsztein says. “We are making science move faster than it ever has before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MBI blueprint for funding cures for rare diseases is replicable, and likely to disrupt the standard way health care research is funded and carried out by radically shortening the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From despair to strength&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his initial diagnosis at age 9, Frederico went through a nine-hour brain surgery and came to the United States to receive standard treatment. Goldsztein looked on helplessly as his son received radiation and then nine grueling rounds of chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First pioneered in the 1980s, this standard treatment protocol cures 70 percent of children. Still, it leaves most of them with lifelong side effects like cognitive problems, endocrine issues that stunt growth, and secondary tumors. Frederico was on the wrong side of that statistic. Just three years later, his tumor relapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldsztein grimaces as he recalls the prognosis he and his wife heard from the doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was unbelievable to me that there had been almost no discoveries in 40 years,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he found hope and partnership in Roger Packer, the director of the Brain Tumor Institute and the Gilbert Family Neurofibromatosis Institute of Children’s National Hospital. He is also the very doctor who created the standard treatment years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer explains that finding effective therapies for medulloblastoma was complex for 30 years because it is an umbrella term for 13 types of tumors. Frederico suffers from the most common one, Group 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason the treatment has not changed is that, until recently, medicine has not advanced enough to detect differences between the different tumor types. Packer explains, “Now with molecular genetic testing and methylation, which is a way to essentially sort tumors, that has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem for Frederico was that very few researchers were working on Group 4, the sub-type of medulloblastoma that is the most common tumor, yet also the one that scientists know the least about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldsztein challenged Packer: “If I can get you the funding, what can your lab do to advance medulloblastoma research quickly?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open-source consortium model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Packer advised that they work together to “try something different,” instead of just throwing money at research without any guideposts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We set up a consortium of leading institutions around the world doing medulloblastoma research, asked them to change their lab approach to focus on the Group 4 tumor, and assigned each lab a question to answer. We charged them with coming up with therapy — not in seven to 10 years, which is the normal transition from discovery to developing a drug and getting it to a patient, but within a two-year timeline,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, seven labs signed on. Today, the Cure Group 4 Consortium is made up of 14 partners and reads like a who’s who of medulloblastoma heavy hitters: Children’s National Hospital, SickKids, Hopp Children’s Cancer Center, and Texas Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labs can only join the consortium if they agree to follow some unusual rules. As Goldsztein explains, “To be accepted into this group and receive funding, there are no silos, and there is no duplicated work. Everyone has a piece of the puzzle, and we work together to move fast. That is the magic of our model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by MIT’s open-source methods, researchers must share data freely with one another to accelerate the group’s overall progress. This kind of partnership across labs and borders is unprecedented in a highly competitive sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mariano Gargiulo MBA ’03 met Goldsztein on the first day of their &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/mit-sloan-fellows-mba-program/introduce-yourself" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Sloan Fellows MBA program&lt;/a&gt; orientation and has been his dear friend ever since. An early-stage donor to MBI and a Houston-based executive in the energy sector, Gargiulo sat down with Goldsztein as he first conceptualized MBI’s operating model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Usually, startup business models plot out the next 10-15 years; Fernando’s timeline was only two years, and his benchmarks were in three-month increments.” It was audaciously optimistic, says Gargiulo, but so was the founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I saw it, I did not doubt that he would achieve his goals. I’m seeing Fernando hit those first targets now and it’s amazing to watch,” Gargiulo says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children’s National Hospital endorsed MBI in 2023 and invited Goldsztein to sit on its foundation’s board, adding credibility to the initiative and his ability to fundraise more ambitiously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Packer, in the next few months, the first two MBI protocols will reach patients for the first time: an immunotherapy protocol, which “leverages the body’s immune response to target cancer cells more effectively and safely than traditional therapies,” and a medulloblastoma vaccine, which “adapts similar methodologies used in Covid-19 vaccine development. This approach aims to provide a versatile and mobile treatment that could be distributed globally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A matter of when&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Goldsztein is not with his own family in Brazil, fundraising, or managing MBI, he is on Zoom with a network of more than 70 other families with children with relapsed medulloblastoma. “I’m not a doctor and I don’t give out medical advice, but with these trials, we are giving each other hope,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope and purpose are commodities that Goldsztein has in spades. “I don’t understand the idea of doing business and accumulating assets, but not helping others,” he says. He shared that message with an auditorium of his fellow alumni &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/alumni/alumni-entrepreneurs-share-life-lessons-and-encourage-action" target="_blank"&gt;at his 2023 MIT Sloan Reunion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frederico, who defied all odds and lived with the threat of recurrence, recently graduated high school. He is interested in international relations and passionate about photography. “This is about finding a cure for Frederico and for all kids,” Goldsztein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how the world would be impacted if MBI found a cure for medulloblastoma, Goldsztein shakes his head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to find the cure. It’s not if, it’s a matter of when.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His next goal is to scale MBI and have it serve as a resource for groups that want to replicate its playbook to solve other childhood diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m never going to stop,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four MIT faculty members are among 23 world-class researchers who have been awarded the nation’s highest honors for scientists and innovators, the White House &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2025/01/03/president-biden-honors-nations-leading-scientists-technologists-and-innovators/" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angela Belcher and Emery Brown were each presented with the National Medal of Science at a ceremony this afternoon, and Paula Hammond ’84, PhD ’93, and Feng Zhang were awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher, the James Mason Crafts Professor of Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, was honored for her work designing novel&amp;nbsp;materials for applications that include solar cells, batteries, and medical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience, was recognized for work that has revealed how anesthesia affects the brain. Brown is also a member of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond, an MIT Institute Professor, vice provost for faculty, and member of the Koch Institute, was honored for developing methods for assembling thin films that can be used for drug delivery, wound healing, and many other applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang, the James and Patricia Poitras Professor of Neuroscience at MIT and a professor of brain and cognitive sciences and biological engineering, was recognized for his work developing molecular tools, including the CRISPR genome-editing system, that have the potential to diagnose and treat disease. Zhang is also an investigator at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research and a core member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two additional MIT alumni also accepted awards:&amp;nbsp;R. Lawrence “Larry” Edwards ’76, a graduate of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and of the Department of Architecture, who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota, received a National Medal of Science for his work in geochemistry. And Noubar Afeyan PhD ’87, a graduate of the Department of Chemical Engineering and current member of the MIT Corporation, accepted one of two National Medals of Technology and Innovation awarded to an organization. These awards went to the biotechnology companies Moderna, which Afeyan co-founded along with Institute Professor Robert Langer, and Pfizer, for their development of vaccines for Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the White House awarded the National Medal of Science to 14 recipients and named nine individual awardees of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, along with two organizations. To date, nearly 100 MIT affiliates have won one of these two honors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emery Brown is at the forefront of the Institute’s collaborations among neuroscience, medicine, and patient care. His research has shifted the paradigm for brain monitoring during general anesthesia for surgery. His pioneering approach based on neural oscillations, as opposed to solely monitoring vital signs, promises to revolutionize how anesthesia medications are delivered to patients,” says Nergis Mavalvala, dean of MIT’s School of Science. “Feng Zhang is one of the preeminent researchers in CRISPR technologies that have accelerated the pace of science and engineering, blending entrepreneurship and scientific discovery. These new molecular technologies can modify the cell’s genetic information, engineer vehicles to deliver these tools into the correct cells, and scale to restore organ function. Zhang will apply these life-altering innovations to diseases such as neurodegeneration, immune disorders, and aging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond and Belcher are frequent collaborators, and each of them has had significant impact on the fields of nanotechnology and nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Angela Belcher and Paula Hammond have made tremendous contributions to science and engineering, and I’m thrilled for each of them to receive this well-deserved recognition,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of the School of Engineering and chief innovation and strategy officer at MIT. “By harnessing the processes of nature, Angela’s innovations have impacted fields from energy to the environment to medicine. Her non-invasive imaging system has improved outcomes for patients diagnosed with many types of cancer. Paula’s pioneering research in nanotechnology helped transform the ways in which we deliver and administer drugs within the body — through her technique, therapeutics can be customized and sent directly to specifically targeted cells, including cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing materials with viruses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher, who joined the MIT faculty in 2002 and served as head of the Department of Biological Engineering from 2019 to 2023, initially heard that she was being considered for the National Medal of Science in September, and in mid-December, found out she had won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was quite shocking and just a huge honor. It’s an honor to be considered, and then to get the email and the call that I actually was receiving it was humbling,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher, who earned a bachelor’s degree in creative studies and a PhD in inorganic chemistry from the University of California at Santa Barbara, has focused much of her research on developing ways to use biological systems, such as viruses, to grow materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since graduate school, I’ve been fascinated with trying to understand how nature makes materials and then applying those processes, whether directly through biological molecules, or through evolving biological molecules or biological organisms, to make materials that are of technological importance,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, she developed a technique for generating materials by engineering viruses to self-assemble into nanoscale scaffolds that can be coated with inorganic materials to form functional devices such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/better-batteries-through-biology-1113"&gt;batteries&lt;/a&gt;, semiconductors,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2011/solar-virus-0425"&gt;solar cells&lt;/a&gt;, and catalysts. This approach allows for exquisite control over the electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the late 2000s, then-MIT president Susan Hockfield asked Belcher to join the newly formed Koch Institute, whose mission is to bring together scientists and engineers to seek new ways to diagnose and treat cancer. Not knowing much about cancer biology, Belcher was hesitant at first, but she ended up moving her lab to the Koch Institute and applying her work to the new challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of her first projects, on which she collaborated with Hammond, was a method for using shortwave infrared light to image cancer cells. This technology, eventually commercialized by a company called Cision Vision, is now being used in hospitals to image lymph nodes during cancer surgery, helping them to determine if a tumor has spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belcher is now focused on finding technologies to detect other cancers, especially ovarian cancer, which is difficult to diagnose in early stages, as well as developing cancer vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking the mysteries of anesthesia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, who has been on the MIT faculty since 2005, said he was “overjoyed” when he found out he would receive the National Medal of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m extremely excited and quite honored to receive such an award, because it is one of the pinnacles of recognition in the scientific field in the United States,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Brown’s work has focused on achieving a better understanding of what happens in the human brain under anesthesia. Trained as an anesthesiologist, Brown earned his MD from Harvard Medical School and a PhD in statistics from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1992, he has been a member of the Harvard Medical School faculty and a practicing anesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Early in his research career, he worked on developing methods to characterize the properties of the human circadian clock. These included characterizing the clock’s phase response curve to light, accurately measuring its intrinsic period, and measuring the impact of physiologically designed schedules on shift worker performance. Later, he became interested in developing signal processing methods to characterize how neurons represent signals and stimuli in their ensemble activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Matt Wilson, an MIT professor of neuroscience, Brown devised algorithms to decode the position of an animal in its environment by reading the activity of a small group of place cell neurons in the animal’s brain. Other applications of these methods included characterizing learning, controlling brain-machine interfaces, and controlling brain states such as medically induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was practicing anesthesia at the time, and as I saw more and more of what the neuroscientists were doing, it occurred to me we could use their paradigms to study anesthesia, and we should, because we weren’t doing that,” he says. “Anesthesia was not being looked at as a neuroscience subdiscipline. It was looked at as a subdiscipline of pharmacology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past two decades, Brown’s work has revealed how anesthesia drugs induce unconsciousness in the brain, along with other altered arousal states. Anesthesia drugs such as propofol dramatically&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/study-finds-tracking-brain-waves-could-reduce-post-complications-0717"&gt;alter the brain’s intrinsic oscillations.&lt;/a&gt; These oscillations can be seen with electroencephalography (EEG).&amp;nbsp;During the awake state, these oscillations usually have high frequency and low amplitude, but as anesthetic drugs are given, they shift generally to low frequency, high amplitude. Working with MIT professors Earl Miller and Ila Fiete, as well as collaborators at Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University, Brown has shown that these changes&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-reveals-how-anesthesia-drug-induces-unconsciousnes-0715"&gt;disrupt normal communication&lt;/a&gt; between different brain regions, leading to loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown has also shown that these EEG oscillations can be used to monitor whether a patient is too deeply unconscious, and he has developed a closed-loop anesthesia delivery system that can maintain a patient’s anesthesia state at precisely desired levels. Brown and colleagues have also developed methods to accelerate recovery from anesthesia. More precise control and accelerated recovery could help to prevent the cognitive impairments that often affect patients after they emerge from anesthesia. Accelerating recovery from anesthesia has also suggested ways to accelerate recovery from coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building multifunctional materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammond, who earned both her bachelor’s degree and PhD in chemical engineering from MIT, has been a member of the faculty since 1995 and was named an Institute Professor in 2021. She was also the 2023-24 recipient of MIT’s Killian Award, the highest honor that the faculty bestows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in her career, Hammond developed a novel technique for generating functional thin-film materials by stacking layers of charged polymeric materials. This approach can be used to build polymers with highly controlled architectures by alternately exposing a surface to positively and negatively charged particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She initially used this layer-by-layer assembly technique to build ultrathin batteries and fuel cell electrodes, before turning her attention to biomedical applications. To adapt the films for drug delivery, she came up with ways to incorporate drug molecules into the layers of the film. These molecules are then released when the particles reach their targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We began to look at bioactive materials and how we could sandwich them into these layers and use that as a way to deliver the drug in a very controlled fashion, at the right time and in the right place,” she says. “We are using the layering as a way to modify the surface of a nanoparticle so that there is a very high and selective affinity for the cancer cells we’re targeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this technique, she has created&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/how-different-cancer-cells-respond-drug-delivering-nanoparticles-0721"&gt;drug-delivery nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt; that are coated with molecules that specifically target cancer cells, with a particular focus on ovarian cancer. These particles can be tailored to carry chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin, immunotherapy agents, or nucleic acids such as messenger RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with colleagues around MIT, she has also developed materials that can be used to promote wound healing,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/two-component-system-halt-internal-bleeding-0425"&gt;blood clotting&lt;/a&gt;, and tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we have found is that these layers are very versatile. They can coat a very broad range of substrates, and those substrates can be anything from a bone implant, which can be quite large, down to a nanoparticle, which is 100 nanometers,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Designing molecular tools&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang, who earned his undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 2004, has contributed to the development of multiple molecular tools to accelerate the understanding of human disease. While a graduate student at Stanford University, from which he received his PhD in 2009, Zhang worked in the lab of Professor Karl Deisseroth. There, he worked on a protein called channelrhodopsin, which he and Deisseroth believed held potential for engineering mammalian cells to respond to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting technique, known as optogenetics, is now used widely used in neuroscience and other fields. By engineering neurons to express light-sensitive proteins such as channelrhodopsin, researchers can either stimulate or silence the cells’ electrical impulses by shining different wavelengths of light on them. This has allowed for detailed study of the roles of specific populations of neurons in the brain, and the mapping of neural circuits that control a variety of behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, about a month after joining the MIT faculty, Zhang attended a talk by Harvard Medical School Professor Michael Gilmore, who studies the pathogenic bacterium &lt;em&gt;Enteroccocus&lt;/em&gt;. The scientist mentioned that these bacteria protect themselves from viruses with DNA-cutting enzymes known as nucleases, which are part of a defense system known as CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had no idea what CRISPR was, but I was interested in nucleases,” Zhang told &lt;em&gt;MIT News&lt;/em&gt; in 2016. “I went to look up CRISPR, and that’s when I realized you might be able to engineer it for use for genome editing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, Zhang and members of his lab reported that they had successfully used CRISPR to &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2013/editing-the-genome-with-high-precision-0103"&gt;edit genes&lt;/a&gt; in mammalian cells. The CRISPR system includes a nuclease called Cas9, which can be directed to cut a specific genetic target by RNA molecules known as guide strands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, scientists in fields from medicine to plant biology have used CRISPR to study gene function and investigate the possibility of correcting faulty genes that cause disease. More recently, Zhang’s lab has devised many enhancements to the original CRISPR system, such as making the targeting more precise and preventing unintended cuts in the wrong locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Medal of Science was established in 1959 and is administered for the White House by the National Science Foundation. The medal recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Medal of Technology and Innovation was established in 1980 and is administered for the White House by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Patent and Trademark Office. The award recognizes those who have made lasting contributions to America’s competitiveness and quality of life and helped strengthen the nation’s technological workforce.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="351391525" paraeid="{ec047d04-b67a-4223-a060-e2747b0d0724}{212}"&gt;At an early age, Katie Spivakovsky learned to study the world from different angles. Dinner-table conversations at her family’s home in Menlo Park, California, often leaned toward topics like the Maillard reaction — the chemistry behind food browning — or the fascinating mysteries of prime numbers. Spivakovsky’s parents, one of whom studied physical chemistry and the other statistics, fostered a love of knowledge that crossed disciplines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="481279308" paraeid="{ec047d04-b67a-4223-a060-e2747b0d0724}{244}"&gt;In high school, Spivakovsky explored it all, from classical literature to computer science. She knew she wanted an undergraduate experience that encouraged her broad interests, a place where every field was within reach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="182817978" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{1}"&gt;“MIT immediately stood out,” Spivakovsky says. “But it was specifically the existence of &lt;a href="https://neet.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;New Engineering Education Transformation&lt;/a&gt; (NEET) — a truly unique initiative that immerses undergraduates in interdisciplinary opportunities both within and beyond campus — that solidified my belief that MIT was the perfect fit for me.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1637811097" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{13}"&gt;NEET is a cross-departmental education program that empowers undergraduates to tackle the pressing challenges of the 21st century through interdisciplinary learning. Starting in their sophomore year, NEET scholars choose from one of four domains of study, or “threads:” Autonomous Machines, Climate and Sustainability Systems, Digital Cities, or Living Machines. After the typical four years, NEET scholars graduate with a degree in their major and a NEET certificate, equipping them with both depth in their chosen field and the ability to work in, and drive impact across, multiple domains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="718770284" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{29}"&gt;Spivakovsky is now a junior double-majoring in biological engineering and artificial intelligence and decision-making, with a minor in mathematics. At a time when fields like biology and computer science are merging like never before, she describes herself as “interested in leveraging engineering and computational tools to discover new biomedical insights” — a central theme of &lt;a href="https://neet.mit.edu/threads/lm"&gt;NEET’s Living Machines thread&lt;/a&gt;, in which she is now enrolled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1953344293" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{71}"&gt;“NEET is about more than engineering,” says Amitava “Babi” Mitra, NEET founding executive director. “It’s about nurturing young engineers who dream big, value collaboration, and are ready to tackle the world’s toughest challenges with heart and curiosity. Watching students like Katie thrive is why this program matters so deeply.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2107976981" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{85}"&gt;Spivakovsky’s achievements while at MIT already have a global reach. In 2023, she led an undergraduate team at the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition in Paris, France, where they presented a proof of concept for a therapy to treat cancer cachexia. Cachexia is a fat- and muscle-wasting condition with no FDA-approved treatment. The condition affects 80 percent of late-stage cancer patients and is responsible for 30 percent of cancer deaths. Spivakovsky’s team won a silver medal for proposing the engineering of macrophages to remove excess interleukin-6, a pro-inflammatory protein overproduced in cachexia patients, and their research was later published in MIT’s &lt;em&gt;Undergraduate Research Journal&lt;/em&gt;, an honor she says was “unreal and humbling.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="850791152" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{129}"&gt;Spivakovsky works as a student researcher in the BioNanoLab of Mark Bathe, professor of biological engineering and former NEET faculty director. The lab uses DNA and RNA to engineer nanoscale materials for such uses as therapeutics and computing. Her focus is validating nucleic acid nanoparticles for use in therapeutics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1032405378" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{139}"&gt;According to Bathe, “Katie shows tremendous promise as a scientific leader — she brings unparalleled passion and creativity to her project on making novel vaccines with a depth of knowledge in both biology and computation that is truly unmatched.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1779829053" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{149}"&gt;Spivakovsky says class 20.054 (Living Machines Research Immersion), which she is taking in the NEET program, complements her work in Bathe’s lab and provides well-rounded experience through workshops that emphasize scientific communication, staying abreast of scientific literature, and research progress updates. “I’m interested in a range of subjects and find that switching between them helps keep things fresh,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1617918237" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{163}"&gt;Her interdisciplinary drive took her to Merck over the summer, where Spivakovsky interned on the Modeling and Informatics team. While contributing to the development of a drug to deactivate a cancer-causing protein, she says she learned to use computational chemistry tools and developed geometric analysis techniques to identify locations on the protein where drug molecules might be able to bind.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1391805582" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{179}"&gt;“My team continues to actively use the software I developed and the insights I gained through my work,” Spivakovsky says. “The target protein has an enormous patient population, so I am hopeful that within the next decade, drugs will enter the market, and my small contribution may make a difference in many lives.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1605726295" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{189}"&gt;As she looks toward her future, Spivakovsky envisions herself at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biology, ideally in a role that combines wet lab with computational research. “I can’t see myself in a career entirely devoid of one or the other,” she says. “This incredible synergy is where I feel most inspired.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="738692707" paraeid="{e58cf491-4765-4315-b3ce-483320b11d4d}{199}"&gt;Wherever Spivakovsky’s curiosity leads her next, she says one thing is certain: “NEET has really helped my development as a scientist.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="3" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{212}"&gt;Throughout 2024, MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research has celebrated 50 years of MIT’s cancer research program and the individuals who have shaped its journey. In honor of this milestone anniversary year, on Nov. 19 the Koch Institute celebrated the opening of a new exhibition: Object Lessons: Celebrating 50 Years of Cancer Research at MIT in 10 Items.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p paraid="3" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{212}"&gt;Object Lessons invites the public to explore significant artifacts — from one of the earliest PCR machines, developed in the lab of Nobel laureate H. Robert Horvitz, to Greta, a groundbreaking zebra fish from the lab of Professor Nancy Hopkins — in the half-century of discoveries and advancements that have positioned MIT at the forefront of the fight against cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="2" paraid="4" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{244}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;50 years of innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="6" paraeid="{6b133ffa-7ff4-4510-93ca-b095c3392f0d}{250}"&gt;The exhibition provides a glimpse into the many contributors and advancements that have defined MIT’s cancer research history since the founding of the Center for Cancer Research in 1974. When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, very little was understood about the biology of cancer, and it aimed to deepen our understanding of cancer and develop better strategies for the prevention, detection, and treatment of the disease. MIT embraced this call to action, establishing a center where many leading biologists tackled cancer’s fundamental questions. Building on this foundation, the Koch Institute opened its doors in 2011, housing engineers and life scientists from many fields under one roof to accelerate progress against cancer in novel and transformative ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="7" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{49}"&gt;In the 13 years since, the Koch Institute’s collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to cancer research has yielded significant advances in our understanding of the underlying biology of cancer and allowed for the translation of these discoveries into meaningful patient impacts. Over 120 spin-out companies — many headquartered nearby in the Kendall Square area — have their roots in Koch Institute research, with nearly half having advanced their technologies to clinical trials or commercial applications. The Koch Institute’s collaborative approach extends beyond its labs: principal investigators often form partnerships with colleagues at world-renowned medical centers, bridging the gap between discovery and clinical impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="801031442" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{59}"&gt;Current Koch Institute Director Matthew Vander Heiden, also a practicing oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, is driven by patient stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="8" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{65}"&gt;“It is never lost on us that the work we do in the lab is important to change the reality of cancer for patients,” he says. “We are constantly motivated by the urgent need to translate our research and improve outcomes for those impacted by cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" paraid="9" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{75}"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbols of progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="10" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{81}"&gt;The items on display as part of Object Lessons take viewers on a journey through five decades of MIT cancer research, from the pioneering days of Salvador Luria, founding director of the Center for Cancer Research, to some of the Koch Institute’s newest investigators, including Francisco Sánchez-Rivera, the Eisen and Chang Career Development Professor and an assistant professor of biology, and Jessica Stark, the Underwood-Prescott Career Development Professor and an assistant professor of biological engineering and chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="11" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{103}"&gt;Among the standout pieces is a humble yet iconic object: Salvador Luria’s ceramic mug, emblazoned with “Luria’s broth.” Lysogeny broth, often called — apocryphally — Luria Broth, is a medium for growing bacteria. Still in use today, the recipe was first published in 1951 by a research associate in Luria’s lab. The artifact, on loan from the MIT Museum, symbolizes the foundational years of the Center for Cancer Research and serves as a reminder of Luria’s influence as an early visionary. His work set the stage for a new era of biological inquiry that would shape cancer research at MIT for generations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="12" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{147}"&gt;Visitors can explore firsthand how the Koch Institute continues to build on the legacy of its predecessors, translating decades of knowledge into new tools and therapies that have the potential to transform patient care and cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1754580287" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{153}"&gt;For instance, the PCR machine designed in the Horvitz Lab in the 1980s made genetic manipulation of cells easier, and gene sequencing faster and more cost-effective. At the time of its commercialization, this groundbreaking benchtop unit marked a major leap forward. In the decades since, technological advances have allowed for the visualization of DNA and biological processes at a much smaller scale, as demonstrated by the handheld BioBits imaging device developed by Stark and on display next door to the Horvitz panel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="2026162156" paraeid="{3cd7ccfb-26ff-41d9-91eb-99186b733e57}{205}" lang="EN-US"&gt;“We created BioBits kits to address a need for increased equity in STEM education,” Stark says. “By making hands-on biology education approachable and affordable, BioBits kits are helping inspire and empower the next generation of scientists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="595247363" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{201}"&gt;While the exhibition showcases scientific discoveries and marvels of engineering, it also aims to underscore the human element of cancer research through personally significant items, such as a messenger bag and Seq-Well device belonging to Alex Shalek, J. W. Kieckhefer Professor in the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Department of Chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="15" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{223}"&gt;Shalek&amp;nbsp;investigates the molecular differences between individual cells, developing mobile RNA-sequencing devices. He could often be seen toting the bag around the Boston area and worldwide as he perfected and shared his technology with collaborators near and far. Through his work, Shalek has helped to make single-cell sequencing accessible for labs in more than 30 countries across six continents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="16" paraeid="{90dc72c2-d333-429e-8c3d-df4ed7db265b}{251}"&gt;“The KI seamlessly brings together students, staff, clinicians, and faculty across multiple different disciplines to collaboratively derive transformative insights into cancer,” Shalek says. “To me, these sorts of partnerships are the best part about being at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="17" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{2}"&gt;Around the corner from Shalek’s display, visitors will find an object that serves as a stark reminder of the real people impacted by Koch Institute research: Steven Keating’s SM ’12, PhD ’16 3D-printed model of his own brain tumor. Keating, who passed away in 2019, became a fierce advocate for the rights of patients to their medical data, and came to know Vander Heiden through his pursuit to become an expert on his tumor type, IDH-mutant glioma. In the years since, Vander Heiden’s work has contributed to a new therapy to treat Keating’s tumor type. In 2024, the drug, called vorasidenib, gained FDA approval, providing the first therapeutic breakthrough for Keating’s cancer in more than 20 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="18" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{36}"&gt;As the Koch Institute looks to the future, Object Lessons stands as a celebration of the people, the science, and the culture that have defined MIT’s first half-century of breakthroughs and contributions to the field of cancer research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="19" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{42}"&gt;“Working in the uniquely collaborative environment of the Koch Institute and MIT, I am confident that we will continue to unlock key insights in the fight against cancer,” says Vander Heiden. “Our community is poised to embark on our next 50 years with the same passion and innovation that has carried us this far.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="582443480" paraeid="{324e93ce-641e-465b-8e7b-790273263246}{52}"&gt;Object Lessons is on view in the Koch Institute Public Galleries Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., through spring semester 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

These fragments are often referred to as antigens. Healthy cells will will not have the same short fragments or antigens on their surface, and thus will be spared from attack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1226046463" paraeid="{bf48a105-0c42-408a-9138-b45541c3fdac}{196}" lang="EN-US"&gt;Even with cancer-associated antigens studding their surfaces, tumor cells can still escape attack by presenting a checkpoint protein, which is built to turn off the T cell. Immune checkpoint blockade therapies bind to these “off-switch” proteins and allow the T cell to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1844691266" paraeid="{435a05d8-63e1-406d-b457-a973f36c0592}{34}" lang="EN-US"&gt;Researchers have established that how cancer-associated antigens are distributed throughout a tumor determines how it will respond to checkpoint therapies. Tumors with the same antigen signal across most of its cells respond well, but heterogeneous tumors with subpopulations of cells that each have different antigens, do not. The overwhelming majority of tumors fall into the latter category and are characterized by heterogenous antigen expression. Because the mechanisms behind antigen distribution and tumor response are poorly understood, efforts to improve ICB therapy response in heterogenous tumors have been hindered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1973643720" paraeid="{17ff53e1-053e-4c08-bf58-e7c99b288208}{142}" lang="EN-US"&gt;In a new study, MIT researchers analyzed antigen expression patterns and associated T cell responses to better understand why patients with heterogenous tumors respond poorly to ICB therapies. In addition to identifying specific antigen architectures that determine how immune systems respond to tumors, the team developed an RNA-based vaccine that, when combined with ICB therapies, was effective at controlling tumors in mouse models of lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="948079172" paraeid="{e23934c7-b81d-468c-86f4-3fb015bab519}{85}" lang="EN-US"&gt;Stefani Spranger, associate professor of biology and member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, is the senior author of the study, &lt;a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/12/11/e010249" target="_blank"&gt;appearing recently in the &lt;em&gt;Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Other contributors include Koch Institute colleague Forest White, the Ned C. (1949) and Janet Bemis Rice Professor and professor of biological engineering at MIT, and Darrell Irvine, professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research Institute and a former member of the Koch Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1051336556" paraeid="{32c58f67-d3aa-4e79-8828-65bb21409358}{170}" lang="EN-US"&gt;While RNA vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials, current practice of antigen selection is based on the predicted stability of antigens on the surface of tumor cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1865802136" paraeid="{32c58f67-d3aa-4e79-8828-65bb21409358}{173}" lang="EN-US"&gt;“It’s not so black-and-white,” says Spranger. “Even antigens that don’t make the numerical cut-off could be really valuable targets. Instead of just focusing on the numbers, we need to look inside the complex interplays between antigen hierarchies to uncover new and important therapeutic strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="965595079" paraeid="{69ef262f-9d27-4a52-b52a-97076b6e0d58}{89}" lang="EN-US"&gt;Spranger and her team created mouse models of lung cancer with a number of different and well-defined expression patterns of cancer-associated antigens in order to analyze how each antigen impacts T cell response. They created both “clonal” tumors, with the same antigen expression pattern across cells, and “subclonal” tumors that represent a heterogenous mix of tumor cell subpopulations expressing different antigens. In each type of tumor, they tested different combinations of antigens with strong or weak binding affinity to MHC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1005625820" paraeid="{74e5c84b-3e9f-433a-9c14-25f763a08b2d}{2}" lang="EN-US"&gt;The researchers found that the keys to immune response were how widespread an antigen is expressed across a tumor, what other antigens are expressed at the same time, and the relative binding strength and other characteristics of antigens expressed by multiple cell populations in the tumor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="532662989" paraeid="{42fb59e4-3b4d-4ac7-80b2-34334c51326d}{143}" lang="EN-US"&gt;As expected, mouse models with clonal tumors were able to mount an immune response sufficient to control tumor growth when treated with ICB therapy, no matter which combinations of weak or strong antigens were present. However, the team discovered that the relative strength of antigens present resulted in dynamics of competition and synergy between T cell populations, mediated by immune recognition specialists called cross-presenting dendritic cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes. In pairings of two weak or two strong antigens, one resulting T cell population would be reduced through competition. In pairings of weak and strong antigens, overall T cell response was enhanced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="957197627" paraeid="{5164917f-4e14-4c17-9146-88f39ccee3cd}{243}" lang="EN-US"&gt;In subclonal tumors, with different cell populations emitting different antigen signals, competition rather than synergy was the rule, regardless of antigen combination. Tumors with a subclonal cell population expressing a strong antigen would be well-controlled under ICB treatment at first, but eventually parts of the tumor lacking the strong antigen began to grow and developed the ability evade immune attack and resist ICB therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1619500616" paraeid="{8a4224c1-911d-4f4b-baa9-1058c0ec7f73}{33}" lang="EN-US"&gt;Incorporating these insights, the researchers then designed an RNA-based vaccine to be delivered in combination with ICB treatment with the goal of strengthening immune responses suppressed by antigen-driven dynamics. Strikingly, they found that no matter the binding affinity or other characteristics of the antigen targeted, the vaccine-ICB therapy combination was able to control tumors in mouse models. The widespread availability of an antigen across tumor cells determined the vaccine’s success, even if that antigen was associated with weak immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p xml:lang="EN-US" paraid="1571726100" paraeid="{76bfd0c7-9995-4c97-be4e-bd93ca14e3b7}{108}" lang="EN-US"&gt;Analysis of clinical data across tumor types showed that the vaccine-ICB therapy combination may be an effective strategy for treating patients with tumors with high heterogeneity. Patterns of antigen architectures in patient tumors correlated with T cell synergy or competition in mice models and determined responsiveness to ICB in cancer patients. In future work with the Irvine laboratory at the Scripps Research Institute, the Spranger laboratory will further optimize the vaccine with the aim of testing the therapy strategy in the clinic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/breast-cancer/about/how-common-is-breast-cancer.html" target="_blank"&gt;second most common&lt;/a&gt; type of cancer and cause of cancer death for women in the United States, affecting one in eight women overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most women with breast cancer undergo lumpectomy surgery to remove the tumor and a rim of healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. After the procedure, the removed tissue is sent to a pathologist to look for signs of disease at the edge of the tissue assessed. Unfortunately, about 20 percent of women who have lumpectomies must undergo a second surgery to remove more tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, an MIT spinout is giving surgeons a real-time view of cancerous tissue during surgery. Lumicell has developed a handheld device and an optical imaging agent that, when combined, allow surgeons to scan the tissue within the surgical cavity to visualize residual cancer cells.&amp;nbsp; The surgeons see these images on a monitor that can guide them to remove additional tissue during the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a clinical trial of 357 patients, Lumicell’s technology not only reduced the need for second surgeries but also revealed tissue suspected to contain cancer cells that may have otherwise been missed by the standard of care lumpectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the technology earlier this year, marking a major milestone for Lumicell and the founders, who include MIT professors Linda Griffith and Moungi Bawendi along with PhD candidate W. David Lee ’69, SM ’70. Much of the early work developing and testing the system took place at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, beginning in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA approval also held deep personal significance for some of Lumicell’s team members, including Griffith, a two-time breast cancer survivor, and Lee, whose wife’s passing from the disease in 2003 changed the course of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An interdisciplinary approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee ran a technology consulting group for 25 years before his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. Watching her battle the disease inspired him to develop technologies that could help cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His neighbor at the time was Tyler Jacks, the founding director of the Koch Institute. Jacks invited Lee to a series of meetings at the Koch involving professors Robert Langer and Bawendi, and Lee eventually joined the Koch Institute as an integrative program officer in 2008, where he began exploring an approach for improving imaging in living organisms with single-cell resolution using charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CCD pixels at the time were each 2 or 3 microns and spaced 2 or 3 microns,” Lee explains. “So the idea was very simple: to stabilize a camera on a tissue so it would move with the breathing of the animal, so the pixels would essentially line up with the cells without any fancy magnification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work led Lee to begin meeting regularly with a multidisciplinary group including Lumicell co-founders Bawendi, currently the Lester Wolfe Professor of Chemistry at MIT and winner of the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-chemist-moungi-bawendi-shares-nobel-prize-chemistry-1004" target="_blank"&gt;2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry&lt;/a&gt;; Griffith, the School of Engineering Professor of Teaching Innovation in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and an extramural faculty member at the Koch Institute; Ralph Weissleder, a professor at Harvard Medical School; and David Kirsch, formerly a postdoc at the Koch Institute and now a scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On Friday afternoons, we’d get together, and Moungi would teach us some chemistry, Lee would teach us some engineering, and David Kirsch would teach some biology,” Griffith recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through those meetings, the researchers began to explore the effectiveness of combining Lee’s imaging approach with engineered proteins that would light up where the immune system meets the edge of tumors, for use during surgery. To begin testing the idea, the group received funding from the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Kathy and Curt Marble Cancer Research Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Without that support, this never would have happened,” Lee says. “When I was learning biology at MIT as an undergrad, genetics weren’t even in the textbooks yet. But the Koch Institute provided education, funding, and most importantly, connections to faculty, who were willing to teach me biology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, Griffith was diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Going through that personal experience, I understood the impact that we could have,” Griffith says. “I had a very unusual situation and a bad kind of tumor. The whole thing was nerve-wracking, but one of the most nerve-wracking times was waiting to find out if my tumor margins were clear after surgery. I experienced that uncertainty and dread as a patient, so I became hugely sensitized to our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach Lumicell’s founders eventually settled on begins two to six hours before surgery, when patients receive the optical imaging agent through an IV.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Then, during surgery, surgeons use Lumicell’s handheld imaging device to scan the walls of the breast cavity. Lumicell’s cancer detection software shows spots that highlight regions suspected to contain residual cancer on the computer monitor, which the surgeon can then remove. The process adds less than 7 minutes on average to the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The technology we developed allows the surgeon to scan the actual cavity, whereas pathology only looks at the lump removed, and [pathologists] make their assessment based on looking at about 1 or 2 percent of the surface area,” Lee says. “Not only are we detecting cancer that was left behind to potentially eliminate second surgeries, we are also, very importantly, finding cancer in some patients that wouldn't be found in pathology and may not generate a second surgery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring other cancer types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lumicell is currently exploring if its imaging agent is activated in other tumor types, including prostate, sarcoma, esophageal, gastric, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee ran Lumicell between 2008 and 2020. After stepping down as CEO, he decided to return to MIT to get his PhD in neuroscience, a full 50 years since he earned his master’s. Shortly thereafter, Howard Hechler took over as Lumicell’s president and chief operating officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Griffith credits MIT’s culture of learning for the formation of Lumicell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People like David [Lee] and Moungi care about solving problems,” Griffith says. “They’re technically brilliant, but they also love learning from other people, and that’s what makes makes MIT special. People are confident about what they know, but they are also comfortable in that they don’t know everything, which drives great collaboration. We work together so that the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients with late-stage cancer often have to endure multiple rounds of different types of treatment, which can cause unwanted side effects and may not always help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of expanding the treatment options for those patients, MIT researchers have designed tiny particles that can be implanted at a tumor site, where they deliver two types of therapy: heat and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could avoid the side effects that often occur when chemotherapy is given intravenously, and the synergistic effect of the two therapies may extend the patient’s lifespan longer than giving one treatment at a time. In a study of mice, the researchers showed that this therapy completely eliminated tumors in most of the animals and significantly prolonged their survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the examples where this particular technology could be useful is trying to control the growth of really fast-growing tumors,” says Ana Jaklenec, a principal investigator at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. “The goal would be to gain some control over these tumors for patients that don't really have a lot of options, and this could either prolong their life or at least allow them to have a better quality of life during this period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaklenec is one of the senior authors of the new study, along with Angela Belcher, the James Mason Crafts Professor of Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute, and Robert Langer, an MIT Institute Professor and member of the Koch Institute. Maria Kanelli, a former MIT postdoc, is the lead author of the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.4c07843" target="_blank"&gt;paper, which appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual therapy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with advanced tumors usually undergo a combination of treatments, including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Phototherapy is a newer treatment that involves implanting or injecting particles that are heated with an external laser, raising their temperature enough to kill nearby tumor cells without damaging other tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current approaches to phototherapy in clinical trials make use of gold nanoparticles, which emit heat when exposed to near-infrared light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team wanted to come up with a way to deliver phototherapy and chemotherapy together, which they thought could make the treatment process easier on the patient and might also have synergistic effects. They decided to use an inorganic material called molybdenum sulfide as the phototherapeutic agent. This material converts laser light to heat very efficiently, which means that low-powered lasers can be used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create a microparticle that could deliver both of these treatments, the researchers combined molybdenum disulfide nanosheets with either doxorubicin, a hydrophilic drug, or violacein, a hydrophobic drug. To make the particles, molybdenum disulfide and the chemotherapeutic are mixed with a polymer called polycaprolactone and then dried into a film that can be pressed into microparticles of different shapes and sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, the researchers created cubic particles with a width of 200 micrometers. Once injected into a tumor site, the particles remain there throughout the treatment. During each treatment cycle, an external near-infrared laser is used to heat up the particles. This laser can penetrate to a depth of a few millimeters to centimeters, with a local effect on the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The advantage of this platform is that it can act on demand in a pulsatile manner,” Kanelli says. “You administer it once through an intratumoral injection, and then using an external laser source you can activate the platform, release the drug, and at the same time achieve thermal ablation of the tumor cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To optimize the treatment protocol, the researchers used machine-learning algorithms to figure out the laser power, irradiation time, and concentration of the phototherapeutic agent that would lead to the best outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That led them to design a laser treatment cycle that lasts for about three minutes. During that time, the particles are heated to about 50 degrees Celsius, which is hot enough to kill tumor cells. Also at this temperature, the polymer matrix within the particles begins to melt, releasing some of the chemotherapy drug contained within the matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This machine-learning-optimized laser system really allows us to deploy low-dose, localized chemotherapy by leveraging the deep tissue penetration of near-infrared light for pulsatile, on-demand photothermal therapy. This synergistic effect results in low systemic toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens,” says Neelkanth Bardhan, a Break Through Cancer research scientist in the Belcher Lab, and second author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating tumors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested the microparticle treatment in mice that were injected with an aggressive type of cancer cells from triple-negative breast tumors. Once tumors formed, the researchers implanted about 25 microparticles per tumor, and then performed the laser treatment three times, with three days in between each treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a powerful demonstration of the usefulness of near-infrared-responsive material systems,” says Belcher, who, along with Bardhan, has previously worked on near-infrared imaging systems for diagnostic and treatment applications in ovarian cancer. “Controlling the drug release at timed intervals with light, after just one dose of particle injection, is a game changer for less painful treatment options and can lead to better patient compliance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice that received this treatment, the tumors were completely eradicated, and the mice lived much longer than those that were given either chemotherapy or phototherapy alone, or no treatment. Mice that underwent all three treatment cycles also fared much better than those that received just one laser treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The polymer used to make the particles is biocompatible and has already been FDA-approved for medical devices. The researchers now hope to test the particles in larger animal models, with the goal of eventually evaluating them in clinical trials. They expect that this treatment could be useful for any type of solid tumor, including metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Bodossaki Foundation, the Onassis Foundation, a Mazumdar-Shaw International Oncology Fellowship, a National Cancer Institute Fellowship, and the Koch Institute Support (core) Grant from the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A new framework to efficiently screen drugs</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Novel method to scale phenotypic drug screening drastically reduces the number of input samples, costs, and labor required to execute a screen.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some of the most widely used drugs today, including penicillin, were discovered through a process called phenotypic screening. Using this method, scientists are essentially throwing drugs at a problem — for example, when attempting to stop bacterial growth or fixing a cellular defect — and then observing what happens next, without necessarily first knowing how the drug works. Perhaps surprisingly, historical data show that this approach is better at yielding approved medicines than those investigations that more narrowly focus on specific molecular targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many scientists believe that properly setting up the problem is the true key to success. Certain microbial infections or genetic disorders caused by single mutations are much simpler to prototype than complex diseases like cancer.&amp;nbsp;These require intricate biological models that are far harder to make or acquire. The result is a bottleneck in the number of drugs that can be tested, and thus the usefulness of phenotypic screening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of scientists led by the &lt;a href="https://shaleklab.com/"&gt;Shalek Lab at MIT&lt;/a&gt; has developed a promising new way to address the difficulty of applying phenotyping screening to scale. Their method allows researchers to simultaneously apply multiple drugs to a biological problem at once, and then computationally work backward to figure out the individual effects of each. For instance, when the team applied this method to models of pancreatic cancer and human immune cells, they were able to uncover surprising new biological insights, while also minimizing cost and sample requirements by several-fold — solving a few problems in scientific research at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amp.profiles.ucsf.edu/zev.gartner"&gt;Zev Gartner&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of California at San Francisco, says this new method has great potential. “I think if there is a strong phenotype one is interested in, this will be a very powerful approach,” Gartner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02403-z"&gt;research was published&lt;/a&gt; Oct. 8 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology.&lt;/em&gt; It was led by Ivy Liu, Walaa Kattan, Benjamin Mead, Conner Kummerlowe, and &lt;a href="https://imes.mit.edu/people/shalek-alex-k"&gt;Alex K. Shalek&lt;/a&gt;, the director of the Institute for Medical Engineering and Sciences (IMES) and the Health Innovation Hub at MIT, as well as the J. W. Kieckhefer Professor in IMES and the Department of Chemistry. It was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “crazy” way to increase scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technological advances over the past decade have revolutionized our understanding of the inner lives of individual cells, setting the stage for richer phenotypic screens. However, many challenges remain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one, biologically representative models like organoids and primary tissues are only available in limited quantities. The most informative tests, like single-cell RNA sequencing, are also expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the team decided to test out the “bold, maybe even crazy idea” to mix everything together, says Liu, a PhD student in the MIT Computational and Systems Biology program. In other words, they chose to combine many perturbations — things like drugs, chemical molecules, or biological compounds made by cells — into one single concoction, and then try to decipher their individual effects afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began testing their workflow by making different combinations of 316 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. “It’s a high bar: basically, the worst-case scenario,” says Liu. “Since every drug is known to have a strong effect, the signals could have been impossible to disentangle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These random combinations ranged from three to 80 drugs per pool, each of which was applied to lab-grown cells. The team then tried to understand the effects of the individual drug using a linear computational model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a success. When compared with traditional tests for each individual drug, the new method yielded comparable results, successfully finding the strongest drugs and their respective effects in each pool, at a fraction of the cost, samples, and effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting it into practice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the method’s applicability to address real-world health challenges, the team then approached two problems that were previously unimaginable with past phenotypic screening techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first test focused on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the deadliest types of cancer.&amp;nbsp;In PDAC, many types of signals come from the surrounding cells in the tumor's environment. These signals can influence how the tumor progresses and responds to treatments. So, the team wanted to identify the most important ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using their new method to pool different signals in parallel, they found several surprise candidates. “We never could have predicted some of our hits,” says Shalek. These included two previously overlooked cytokines that actually could predict survival outcomes of patients with PDAC in public cancer data sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second test looked at the effects of 90 drugs on adjusting the immune system’s function. These drugs were applied to fresh human blood cells, which contain a complex mix of different types of immune cells. Using their new method and single-cell RNA-sequencing, the team could not only test a large library of drugs, but also separate the drugs’ effects out for each type of cell. This enabled the team to understand how each drug might work in a more complex tissue, and then select the best one for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We might say there’s a defect in a T cell, so we’re going to add this drug, but we never think about, well, what does that drug do to all of the other cells in the tissue?” says Shalek. “We now have a way to gather this information, so that we can begin to pick drugs to maximize on-target effects and minimize side effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these experiments also showed Shalek the need to build better tools and datasets for creating hypotheses about potential treatments. “The complexity and lack of predictability for the responses we saw tells me that we likely are not finding the right, or most effective, drugs in many instances,” says Shalek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing barriers and improving lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the current compression technique can identify the perturbations with the greatest effects, it’s still unable to perfectly resolve the effects of each one. Therefore, the team recommends that it act as a supplement to support additional screening. “Traditional tests that examine the top hits should follow,” Liu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, however, the new compression framework drastically reduces the number of input samples, costs, and labor required to execute a screen. With fewer barriers in play, it marks an exciting advance for understanding complex responses in different cells and building new models for precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shalek says, “This is really an incredible approach that opens up the kinds of things that we can do to find the right targets, or the right drugs, to use to improve lives for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Cancer biologists discover a new mechanism for an old drug </title>

  <description><![CDATA[Study reveals the drug, 5-fluorouracil, acts differently in different types of cancer — a finding that could help researchers design better drug combinations.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the 1950s, a chemotherapy drug known as 5-fluorouracil has been used to treat many types of cancer, including blood cancers and cancers of the digestive tract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long believed that this drug works by damaging the building blocks of DNA. However, a new study from MIT has found that in cancers of the colon and other gastrointestinal cancers, it actually kills cells by interfering with RNA synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could have a significant effect on how doctors treat many cancer patients. Usually, 5-fluorouracil is given in combination with chemotherapy drugs that damage DNA, but the new study found that for colon cancer, this combination does not achieve the synergistic effects that were hoped for. Instead, combining 5-FU with drugs that affect RNA synthesis could make it more effective in patients with GI cancers, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work is the most definitive study to date showing that RNA incorporation of the drug, leading to an RNA damage response, is responsible for how the drug works in GI cancers,” says Michael Yaffe, a David H. Koch Professor of Science at MIT, the director of the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. “Textbooks implicate the DNA effects of the drug as the mechanism in all cancer types, but our data shows that RNA damage is what’s really important for the types of tumors, like GI cancers, where the drug is used clinically.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaffe, the senior author of the new study, hopes to plan clinical trials of 5-fluorouracil with drugs that would enhance its RNA-damaging effects and kill cancer cells more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jung-Kuei Chen, a Koch Institute research scientist, and Karl Merrick, a former MIT postdoc, are the lead authors of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrm.2024.101778" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unexpected mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians use 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as a first-line drug for colon, rectal, and pancreatic cancers. It’s usually given in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan, which damage DNA in cancer cells. The combination was thought to be effective because 5-FU can disrupt the synthesis of DNA nucleotides. Without those building blocks, cells with damaged DNA wouldn’t be able to efficiently repair the damage and would undergo cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaffe’s lab, which studies cell signaling pathways, wanted to further explore the underlying mechanisms of how these drug combinations preferentially kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers began by testing 5-FU in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan in colon cancer cells grown in the lab. To their surprise, they found that not only were the drugs not synergistic, in many cases they were less effective at killing cancer cells than what one would expect by simply adding together the effects of 5-FU or the DNA-damaging drug given alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One would have expected that these combinations to cause synergistic cancer cell death because you are targeting two different aspects of a shared process: breaking DNA, and making nucleotides,” Yaffe says. “Karl looked at a dozen colon cancer cell lines, and not only were the drugs not synergistic, in most cases they were antagonistic. One drug seemed to be undoing what the other drug was doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaffe’s lab then teamed up with Adam Palmer, an assistant professor of pharmacology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who specializes in analyzing data from clinical trials. Palmer’s research group examined data from colon cancer patients who had been on one or more of these drugs and showed that the drugs did not show synergistic effects on survival in most patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This confirmed that when you give these combinations to people, it’s not generally true that the drugs are actually working together in a beneficial way within an individual patient,” Yaffe says. “Instead, it appears that one drug in the combination works well for some patients while another drug in the combination works well in other patients. We just cannot yet predict which drug by itself is best for which patient, so everyone gets the combination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results led the researchers to wonder just how 5-FU was working, if not by disrupting DNA repair. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells had shown that the drug also gets incorporated into RNA nucleotides, but there has been dispute over&amp;nbsp;how much this RNA damage contributes to the drug’s toxic effects on cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside cells, 5-FU is broken down into two different metabolites. One of these gets incorporated into DNA nucleotides, and other into RNA nucleotides. In studies of colon cancer cells, the researchers found that the metabolite that interferes with RNA was much more effective at killing colon cancer cells than the one that disrupts DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That RNA damage appears to primarily affect ribosomal RNA, a molecule that forms part of the ribosome — a cell organelle responsible for assembling new proteins. If cells can’t form new ribosomes, they can’t produce enough proteins to function. Additionally, the lack of undamaged ribosomal RNA causes cells to destroy a large set of proteins that normally bind up the RNA to make new functional ribosomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are now exploring how this ribosomal RNA damage leads cells to under programmed cell death, or apoptosis. They hypothesize that sensing of the damaged RNAs within cell structures called lysosomes somehow triggers an apoptotic signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My lab is very interested in trying to understand the signaling events during disruption of ribosome biogenesis, particularly in GI cancers and even some ovarian cancers, that cause the cells to die. Somehow, they must be monitoring the quality control of new ribosome synthesis, which somehow is connected to the death pathway machinery,” Yaffe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New combinations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that drugs that stimulate ribosome production could work together with 5-FU to make a highly synergistic combination. In their study, the researchers showed that a molecule that inhibits KDM2A, a suppressor of ribosome production, helped to boost the rate of cell death in colon cancer cells treated with 5-FU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also suggest a possible explanation for why combining 5-FU with a DNA-damaging drug often makes both drugs less effective. Some DNA damaging drugs send a signal to the cell to stop making new ribosomes, which would negate 5-FU’s effect on RNA. A better approach may be to give each drug a few days apart, which would give patients the potential benefits of each drug, without having them cancel each other out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Importantly, our data doesn’t say that these combination therapies are wrong. We know they’re effective clinically. It just says that if you adjust how you give these drugs, you could potentially make those therapies even better, with relatively minor changes in the timing of when the drugs are given,” Yaffe says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now hoping to work with collaborators at other institutions to run a phase 2 or 3 clinical trial in which patients receive the drugs on an altered schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A trial is clearly needed to look for efficacy, but it should be straightforward to initiate because these are already clinically accepted drugs that form the standard of care for GI cancers. All we’re doing is changing the timing with which we give them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also hope that their work could lead to the identification of biomarkers that predict which patients’ tumors will be more susceptible to drug combinations that include 5-FU. One such biomarker could be RNA polymerase I, which is active when cells are producing a lot of ribosomal RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, a fellowship from the Ludwig Center at MIT, the National Institutes of Health, the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund, the Charles and Marjorie Holloway Foundation, and the STARR Cancer Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Danielle Randall Doughty | Department of Chemistry</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A collaboration between four MIT groups, led by principal investigators &lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/laura-l-kiessling/"&gt;Laura L. Kiessling&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/jeremiah-a-johnson/"&gt;Jeremiah A. Johnson&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://chemistry.mit.edu/profile/alex-k-shalek/"&gt;Alex K. Shalek,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://be.mit.edu/directory/darrell-j-irvine"&gt;Darrell J. Irvine&lt;/a&gt;, in conjunction with a group at Georgia Tech led by&lt;a href="https://chemistry.gatech.edu/people/mg-finn"&gt; M.G. Finn&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed a new strategy for enabling immune system mobilization against cancer cells. The work, which &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.4c07360" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;ACS Nano&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, produces exactly the type of anti-tumor immunity needed to function as a tumor vaccine — both prophylactically and therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Cancer cells can look very similar to the human cells from which they are derived. In contrast, viruses, bacteria, and fungi carry carbohydrates on their surfaces that are markedly different from those of human carbohydrates. Dendritic cells — the immune system’s best antigen-presenting cells — carry proteins on their surfaces that help them recognize these atypical carbohydrates and bring those antigens inside of them. The antigens are then processed into smaller peptides and presented to the immune system for a response. Intriguingly, some of these carbohydrate proteins can also collaborate to direct immune responses. This work presents a strategy for targeting those antigens to the dendritic cells that results in a more activated, stronger immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling tumors’ tenacity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The researchers’ new strategy shrouds the tumor antigens with foreign carbohydrates and co-delivers them with single-stranded RNA so that the dendritic cells can be programmed to recognize the tumor antigens as a potential threat. The researchers targeted the lectin (carbohydrate-binding protein) DC-SIGN because of its ability to serve as an activator of dendritic cell immunity. They decorated a virus-like particle (a particle composed of virus proteins assembled onto a piece of RNA that is noninfectious because its internal RNA is not from the virus) with DC-binding carbohydrate derivatives. The resulting glycan-costumed virus-like particles display unique sugars; therefore, the dendritic cells recognize them as something they need to attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“On the surface of the dendritic cells are carbohydrate binding proteins called lectins that combine to the sugars on the surface of bacteria or viruses, and when they do that they penetrate the membrane,” explains Kiessling, the paper’s senior author. “On the cell, the DC-SIGN gets clustered upon binding the virus or bacteria and that promotes internalization. When a virus-like particle gets internalized, it starts to fall apart and releases its RNA.” The toll-like receptor (bound to RNA) and DC-SIGN (bound to the sugar decoration) can both signal to activate the immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Once the dendritic cells have sounded the alarm of a foreign invasion, a robust immune response is triggered that is significantly stronger than the immune response that would be expected with a typical untargeted vaccine. When an antigen is encountered by the dendritic cells, they send signals to T cells, the next cell in the immune system, to give different responses depending on what pathways have been activated in the dendritic cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advancing cancer vaccine development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The activity of a potential vaccine developed in line with this new research is twofold. First, the vaccine glycan coat binds to lectins, providing a primary signal. Then, binding to toll-like receptors elicits potent immune activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Kiessling, Finn, and Johnson groups had previously identified a synthetic DC-SIGN binding group that directed cellular immune responses when used to decorate virus-like particles. But it was unclear whether this method could be utilized as an anticancer vaccine. Collaboration between researchers in the labs at MIT and Georgia Tech demonstrated that in fact, it could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Valerie Lensch, a chemistry PhD student from MIT’s Program in Polymers and Soft Matter and a joint member of the Kiessling and Johnson labs, took the preexisting strategy and tested it as an anticancer vaccine, learning a great deal about immunology in order to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We have developed a modular vaccine platform designed to drive antigen-specific cellular immune responses,” says Lensch. “This platform is not only pivotal in the fight against cancer, but also offers significant potential for combating challenging intracellular pathogens, including malaria parasites, HIV, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium&lt;/em&gt; tuberculosis. This technology holds promise for tackling a range of diseases where vaccine development has been particularly challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lensch and her fellow researchers conducted&amp;nbsp;in vitro experiments with extensive iterations of these glycan-costumed virus-like particles before identifying a design that demonstrated potential for success. Once that was achieved, the researchers were able to move on to an&amp;nbsp;in vivo model, an exciting milestone for their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Adele Gabba, a postdoc in the Kiessling Lab, conducted the in vivo experiments with Lensch, and Robert Hincapie, who conducted his PhD studies with Professor M.G. Finn at Georgia Tech, built and decorated the virus-like particles with a series of glycans that were sent to him from the researchers at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We are discovering that carbohydrates act like a language that cells use to communicate and direct the immune system,” says Gabba. “It's thrilling that we have begun to decode this language and can now harness it to reshape immune responses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The design principles behind this vaccine are rooted in extensive fundamental research conducted by previous graduate student and postdoctoral researchers over many years, focusing on optimizing lectin engagement and understanding the roles of lectins in immunity,” says Lensch. “It has been exciting to witness the translation of these concepts into therapeutic platforms across various applications.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[PhD student Oscar Molina seeks new ways to assemble proteins into targeted cancer therapies, while also encouraging his fellow first-generation graduate students.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Like many children of first-generation immigrants, Oscar Molina grew up feeling like he had two career choices: doctor or lawyer. He seemed destined for the former as he excelled in high school and planned to major in biochemistry at the University of California at Los Angeles, but as an undergraduate, he fell in love with research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was fascinated by discovery. As I did it more in college, I realized I didn’t want to be a doctor,” he says. “Once I saw that I could make an impact and be at the forefront of therapy with biotech, I knew I wanted to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the next couple of years go as planned, his parents will indeed see their son become a doctor — just not exactly the way they might have guessed. He’s entering the fifth year of his PhD program in biology at MIT and is currently working in the lab of Professor Ronald Raines, researching the potential of proteins to kill cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molina, who is the first in his family to attend college, also works to support his fellow students through outreach and community-building efforts. In various roles, including as a Graduate Community Fellow in MIT’s Office of Graduate Education, he sought to connect and encourage students from underrepresented backgrounds as they pursued their own graduate studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a lot of opportunities presented to me that made me ask, ‘Why me?’” he says. “I recognize that they were super valuable, and that’s why I should deliver that back to other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking protein construction chemically&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spirit of giving back isn’t just limited to Molina’s work outside of the lab. He chose chemical biology and the pursuit of new cancer therapies as his research focus partly because his grandfather has been dealing with the disease for the last 10 years. The ultimate goal guiding his research is to make&amp;nbsp;all protein-based cancer therapies more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and other collaborators in the Raines Lab published a paper in June that takes an important step in that direction, suggesting a way to make fusion proteins with greater customization and improved performance. They discovered that a chemical called 3-bromo-5-methylene pyrrolone can be used to combine three proteins efficiently and with high levels of control and modularity, a significant advance given most of the techniques for protein conjugation are only able to combine two at a time in a single spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now, we can have chemical control of where we include different things, where we can kind of plug-and-play,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can now adjust multiple characteristics at the same time — for example, increasing the protein’s half-life or improving its ability to target cancer cells — while still achieving a homogenous end product. They’re also relevant to immune cell redirection therapies, which require&amp;nbsp;multimeric protein chimeras to activate immune clearance of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the most interesting thing to me,” he says. “How do we give a biologic therapy the best opportunity to be active and efficacious?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His upcoming thesis will center around that question as it relates to chemotherapies based on ribonuclease 1, an enzyme that is best-known for cleaving RNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paying it back and paying it forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that thesis will likely demand more of Molina than any other project he’s worked on in the past, he’s no stranger to hard work. After his mother and father left their respective homes of Guatemala and El Salvador in the 1990s, they dedicated their lives to giving their children futures that they themselves didn’t have access to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnessing their efforts impressed two beliefs into Molina’s worldview: the value of education and the importance of support. Among his family, he is the first to graduate from a U.S. high school, the first to attend a four-year college, and the first to attend graduate school. These “firsts” can weigh heavily, and as he began his studies at MIT, he knew how difficult it can be to carry that burden alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I saw the need and wanted to help other people be the first in their family to do things like go to college,” he says. “I also wanted to help people with similar backgrounds to mine, like being an underrepresented minority or a first-generation college student.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That desire led Molina to join MIT’s Office of Graduate Education as a Graduate Community Fellow in January 2022, where he&amp;nbsp;worked on supporting various affinity groups across the Institute. This included helping groups out with logistics, funding applications, community outreach and cross-group collaborations. He also spent part of last summer as a pod leader for the MIT Summer Research Program, which works to prepare underrepresented students for graduate education and research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s also leveraged his personal interests to volunteer with various community organizations in Cambridge and Boston. Despite his numerous commitments, he’s an avid&amp;nbsp;marathon runner, and ran the 2022 Boston Marathon while raising nearly $8000 for Boston Scores, a program that provides educational and athletic opportunities for students in the Boston Public Schools system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Molina plans on&amp;nbsp;joining a startup in Boston’s biotech scene while learning more about the venture capital firms that fund their research. Wherever he ends up, he plans on continuing to apply the core truths that brought him where he is now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to be at the forefront of creating therapies. I really like science. I really like helping others. I really like the ability to create things that are impactful,” he says. “Now it’s time to take that and find my way to what’s next.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Study reveals the benefits and downside of fasting</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-reveals-fasting-benefits-and-downside-0821</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Fasting helps intestinal stem cells regenerate and heal injuries but also leads to a higher risk of cancer in mice, MIT researchers report.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-reveals-fasting-benefits-and-downside-0821</guid>
        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting have been shown to have numerous health benefits: They can delay the onset of some age-related diseases&amp;nbsp;and lengthen lifespan, not only in humans but many other organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many complex mechanisms underlie this phenomenon. Previous work from MIT has shown that one way fasting exerts its beneficial effects is by boosting the regenerative abilities of intestinal stem cells, which helps the intestine recover from injuries or inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study of mice, MIT researchers have now identified the pathway that enables this enhanced regeneration, which is activated once the mice begin “refeeding” after the fast. They also found a downside to this regeneration: When cancerous mutations occurred during the regenerative period, the mice were more likely to develop early-stage intestinal tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having more stem cell activity is good for regeneration, but too much of a good thing over time can have less favorable consequences,” says Omer Yilmaz, an MIT associate professor of biology, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and the senior author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yilmaz adds that further studies are needed before forming any conclusion as to whether fasting has a similar effect in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have a lot to learn, but it is interesting that being in either the state of fasting or refeeding when exposure to mutagen occurs can have a profound impact on the likelihood of developing a cancer in these well-defined mouse models,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT postdocs Shinya Imada and Saleh Khawaled are the lead authors of the paper, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07840-z" target="_blank"&gt;appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Driving regeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For several years, Yilmaz’s lab has been investigating how fasting and low-calorie diets affect intestinal health. In a 2018 &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/fasting-boosts-stem-cells-regenerative-capacity-0503" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, his team reported that during a fast, intestinal stem cells begin to use lipids as an energy source, instead of carbohydrates. They also showed that fasting led to a significant boost in stem cells’ regenerative ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unanswered questions remained: How does fasting trigger this boost in regenerative ability, and when does the regeneration begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since that paper, we’ve really been focused on understanding what is it about fasting that drives regeneration,” Yilmaz says. “Is it fasting itself that’s driving regeneration, or eating after the fast?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers found that stem cell regeneration is suppressed during fasting but then surges&amp;nbsp;during the refeeding period. The researchers followed three groups of mice — one that fasted for 24 hours, another one that fasted for 24 hours and then was allowed to eat whatever they wanted during a 24-hour refeeding period, and a control group that ate whatever they wanted throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed intestinal stem cells’ ability to proliferate at different time points and found that the stem cells showed the highest levels of proliferation at the end of the 24-hour refeeding period. These cells were also more proliferative than intestinal stem cells from mice that had not fasted at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that fasting and refeeding represent two distinct states,” Imada says. “In the fasted state, the ability of cells to use lipids and fatty acids as an energy source enables them to survive when nutrients are low. And then it’s the postfast refeeding state that really drives the regeneration. When nutrients become available, these stem cells and progenitor cells activate programs that enable them to build cellular mass and repopulate the intestinal lining.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further studies revealed that these cells activate a cellular signaling pathway known as mTOR, which is involved in cell growth and metabolism. One of mTOR’s roles is to regulate the translation of messenger RNA into protein, so when it’s activated, cells produce more protein. This protein synthesis is essential for stem cells to proliferate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that mTOR activation in these stem cells also led to production of large quantities of polyamines — small molecules that help cells to grow and divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the refed state, you’ve got more proliferation, and you need to build cellular mass. That requires more protein, to build new cells, and those stem cells go on to build more differentiated cells or specialized intestinal cell types that line the intestine,” Khawaled says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much of a good thing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that when stem cells are in this highly regenerative state, they are more prone to become cancerous. Intestinal stem cells are among the most actively dividing cells in the body, as they help the lining of the intestine completely turn over every five to 10 days. Because they divide so frequently, these stem cells are the most common source of precancerous cells in the intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers discovered that if they turned on a cancer-causing gene in the mice during the refeeding stage, they were much more likely to develop precancerous polyps than if the gene was turned on during the fasting state. Cancer-linked mutations that occurred during the refeeding state were also much more likely to produce polyps than mutations that occurred in mice that did not undergo the cycle of fasting and refeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to emphasize that this was all done in mice, using very well-defined cancer mutations. In humans it’s going to be a much more complex state,” Yilmaz says. “But it does lead us to the following notion: Fasting is very healthy, but if you’re unlucky and you’re refeeding after a fasting, and you get exposed to a mutagen, like a charred steak or something, you might actually be increasing your chances of developing a lesion that can go on to give rise to cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yilmaz also noted that the regenerative benefits of fasting could be significant for people who undergo radiation treatment, which can damage the intestinal lining, or other types of intestinal injury. His lab is now studying whether polyamine supplements could help to stimulate this kind of regeneration, without the need to fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This fascinating study provides insights into the complex interplay between food consumption, stem cell biology, and cancer risk,” says Ophir Klein, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved in the study. “Their work lays a foundation for testing polyamines as compounds that may augment intestinal repair after injuries, and it suggests that careful consideration is needed when planning diet-based strategies for regeneration to avoid increasing cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by Pew-Stewart Scholars Program for Cancer Research award, the MIT Stem Cell Initiative, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Kathy and Curt Marble Cancer Research Fund, and the Bridge Project, a partnership between the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a type of preinvasive tumor that sometimes progresses to a highly deadly form of breast cancer. It accounts for about 25 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it is difficult for clinicians to determine the type and stage of DCIS, patients with DCIS are often overtreated. To address this, an interdisciplinary team of researchers from MIT and ETH Zurich developed an AI model that can identify the different stages of DCIS from a cheap and easy-to-obtain breast tissue image. Their model shows that both the state and arrangement of cells in a tissue sample are important for determining the stage of DCIS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because such tissue images are so easy to obtain, the researchers were able to build one of the largest datasets of its kind, which they used to train and test their model. When they compared its predictions to conclusions of a pathologist, they found clear agreement in many instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the model could be used as a tool to help clinicians streamline the diagnosis of simpler cases without the need for labor-intensive tests, giving them more time to evaluate cases where it is less clear if DCIS will become invasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We took the first step in understanding that we should be looking at the spatial organization of cells when diagnosing DCIS, and now we have developed a technique that is scalable. From here, we really need a prospective study. Working with a hospital and getting this all the way to the clinic will be an important step forward,” says Caroline Uhler, a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), who is also director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and a researcher at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uhler, co-corresponding author of a paper on this research, is joined by lead author Xinyi Zhang, a graduate student in EECS and the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center; co-corresponding author GV Shivashankar, professor of mechogenomics at ETH Zurich jointly with the Paul Scherrer Institute; and others at MIT, ETH Zurich, and the University of Palermo in Italy. The open-access research was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50285-1" target="_blank"&gt;published July 20 in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining imaging with AI&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 30 and 50 percent of patients with DCIS develop a highly invasive stage of cancer, but researchers don’t know the biomarkers that could tell a clinician which tumors will progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can use techniques like multiplexed staining or single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the stage of DCIS in tissue samples. However, these tests are too expensive to be performed widely, Shivashankar explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In previous work, these researchers showed that a cheap imagining technique known as chromatin staining could be as informative as the much costlier single-cell RNA sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this research, they hypothesized that combining this single stain with a carefully designed machine-learning model could provide the same information about cancer stage as costlier techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, they created a dataset containing 560 tissue sample images from 122 patients at three different stages of disease. They used this dataset to train an AI model that learns a representation of the state of each cell in a tissue sample image, which it uses to infer the stage of a patient’s cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, not every cell is indicative of cancer, so the researchers had to aggregate them in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They designed the model to create clusters of cells in similar states, identifying eight states that are important markers of DCIS. Some cell states are more indicative of invasive cancer than others. The model determines the proportion of cells in each state in a tissue sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But in cancer, the organization of cells also changes. We found that just having the proportions of cells in every state is not enough. You also need to understand how the cells are organized,” says Shivashankar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this insight, they designed the model to consider proportion and arrangement of cell states, which significantly boosted its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The interesting thing for us was seeing how much spatial organization matters. Previous studies had shown that cells which are close to the breast duct are important. But it is also important to consider which cells are close to which other cells,” says Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they compared the results of their model with samples evaluated by a pathologist, it had clear agreement in many instances. In cases that were not as clear-cut, the model could provide information about features in a tissue sample, like the organization of cells, that a pathologist could use in decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This versatile model could also be adapted for use in other types of cancer, or even neurodegenerative conditions, which is one area the researchers are also currently exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have shown that, with the right AI techniques, this simple stain can be very powerful. There is still much more research to do, but we need to take the organization of cells into account in more of our studies,” Uhler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute, ETH Zurich, the Paul Scherrer Institute, the Swiss National Science Foundation, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the MIT Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning and Health, the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, and a Simons Investigator Award.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A new way to miniaturize cell production for cancer treatment</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Researchers from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), MIT’s research enterprise in Singapore, have developed a novel way to produce clinical doses of viable autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells in a ultra-small automated closed-system microfluidic chip, roughly the size of a pack of cards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This is the first time that a microbioreactor is used to produce autologous cell therapy products. Specifically, the new method was successfully used to manufacture and expand CAR-T cells that are as effective as cells produced using existing systems in a smaller footprint and less space, and using fewer seeding cell numbers and cell manufacturing reagents. This could lead to more efficient and affordable methods of scaling-out autologous cell therapy manufacturing, and could even potentially enable point-of-care manufacturing of CAR T-cells outside of a laboratory setting — such as in hospitals and wards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;CAR T-cell therapy manufacturing requires the isolation, activation, genetic modification, and expansion of a patient’s own T-cells to kill tumor cells upon reinfusion into the patient. Despite how cell therapies have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy, with some of the first patients who received autologous cell therapies in remission for more than 10 years, the manufacturing process for CAR-T cells has remained inconsistent, costly, and time-consuming. It can be prone to contamination, subject to human error, and requires seeding cell numbers that are impractical for smaller-scale CAR T-cell production. These challenges create bottlenecks that restrict both the availability and affordability of these therapies despite their effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In a paper titled “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01219-1" target="_blank"&gt;A high-density microbioreactor process designed for automated point-of-care manufacturing of CAR T cells&lt;/a&gt;” published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, SMART researchers detailed their breakthrough: Human primary T-cells can be activated, transduced, and expanded to high densities in a 2-mililiter automated closed-system microfluidic chip to produce over 60 million CAR T-cells from donors with lymphoma, and over 200 million CAR T-cells from healthy donors. The CAR T-cells produced using the microbioreactor are as effective as those produced using conventional methods, but in a smaller footprint and less space, and with fewer resources. This translates to lower cost of goods manufactured (COGM), and potentially to lower costs for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The groundbreaking research was led by members of the Critical Analytics for Manufacturing Personalized-Medicine (CAMP) interdisciplinary research group at SMART. Collaborators include researchers from the Duke-NUS Medical School; the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research; KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital; and Singapore General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This advancement in cell therapy manufacturing could ultimately offer a point-of-care platform that could substantially increase the number of CAR T-cell production slots, reducing the wait times and cost of goods of these living medicines — making cell therapy more accessible to the masses. The use of scaled-down bioreactors could also aid process optimization studies, including for different cell therapy products,” says Michael Birnbaum, co-lead principal investigator at SMART CAMP, associate professor of biological engineering at MIT, and a co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With high T-cell expansion rates, similar total T-cell numbers could be attained with a shorter culture period in the microbioreactor (seven to eight days) compared to gas-permeable culture plates (12 days), potentially shortening production times by 30-40 percent. The CAR T-cells from both the microfluidic bioreactor and gas-permeable culture plates only showed subtle differences in cell quality. The cells were equally functional in killing leukemia cells when tested in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This new method suggests that a dramatic miniaturization of current-generation autologous cell therapy production is feasible, with the potential of significantly alleviating manufacturing limitations of CAR T-cell therapy. Such a miniaturization would lay the foundation for point-of-care manufacturing of CAR T-cells and decrease the “good manufacturing practice” (GMP) footprint required for producing cell therapies — which is one of the primary drivers of COGM,” says Wei-Xiang Sin, research scientist at SMART CAMP and first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Notably, the microbioreactor used in the research is a perfusion-based, automated, closed system with the smallest footprint per dose, smallest culture volume and seeding cell number, as well as the highest cell density and level of process control attainable. These microbioreactors — previously only used for microbial and mammalian cell cultures — were originally developed at MIT and have been advanced to commercial production by Millipore Sigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The small starting cell numbers required, compared to existing larger automated manufacturing platforms, means that smaller amounts of isolation beads, activation reagents, and lentiviral vectors are required per production run. In addition, smaller volumes of medium are required (at least tenfold lower than larger automated culture systems) owing to the extremely small culture volume (2 milliliters; approximately 100-fold lower than larger automated culture systems) — which contributes to significant reductions in reagent cost. This could benefit patients, especially pediatric patients who have low or insufficient T-cell numbers to produce therapeutic doses of CAR T-cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Moving forward, SMART CAMP is working on further engineering sampling and/or analytical systems around the microbioreactor so that CAR-T production can be performed with reduced labor and out of a laboratory setting, potentially facilitating the decentralized bedside manufacturing of CAR T-cells. SMART CAMP is also looking to further optimize the process parameters and culture conditions to improve cell yield and quality for future clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The research was conducted by SMART and supported by the National Research Foundation Singapore under its Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) program.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At any given time, millions of T cells circulate throughout the human body, looking for potential invaders. Each of those T cells sports a different T cell receptor, which is specialized to recognize a foreign antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make it easier to understand how that army of T cells recognizes their targets, MIT Associate Professor Michael Birnbaum has developed tools that can be used to study huge numbers of these interactions at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciphering those interactions could eventually help researchers find new ways to reprogram T cells to target specific antigens, such as mutations found in a cancer patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“T-cells are so diverse in terms of what they recognize and what they do, and there's been incredible progress in understanding this on an example-by-example basis. Now, we want to be able to understand the entirety of this process with some of the same level of sophistication that we understand the individual pieces. And we think that once we have that understanding, then we can be much better at manipulating it to positively affect disease,” Birnbaum says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could lead to improvements in immunotherapy to treat cancer, as well as potential new treatments for autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes, or infections such as HIV and Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling difficult problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birnbaum’s interest in immunology developed early, when he was a high school student in Philadelphia. His school offered a program allowing students to work in research labs in the area, so starting in tenth grade, he did research in an immunology lab at Fox Chase Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got exposed to some of the same things I study now, actually, and so that really set me on the path of realizing that this is what I wanted to do,” Birnbaum says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at Harvard University, he enrolled in a newly established major known as chemical and physical biology. During an introductory immunology course, Birnbaum was captivated by the complexity and beauty of the immune system. He went on to earn a PhD in immunology at Stanford University, where he began to study how T cells recognize their target antigens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T cell receptors are protein complexes found on the surfaces of T cells. These receptors are made of gene segments that can be mixed and matched to form up to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; different sequences. When a T cell receptor finds a foreign antigen that it recognizes, it signals the T cell to multiply and begin the process of eliminating the cells that display that antigen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Birnbaum worked on building tools to study interactions between antigens and T cells at large scales. After finishing his PhD, he spent a year doing a postdoc in a neuroscience lab at Stanford, but quickly realized he wanted to get back to immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Birnbaum was hired as a faculty member in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. He was drawn to MIT, he says, by the willingness of scientists and engineers at the Institute to work together to take on difficult, important problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a fearlessness to how people were willing to do that,” he says. “And the community, particularly the immunology community here, was second to none, both in terms of its quality, but also in terms of how supportive it was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billions of targets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Birnbaum’s lab focuses on T cell-antigen interactions, with the hope of eventually being able to reprogram those interactions to help fight diseases such as cancer. In 2022, he reported a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/immune-cells-proteins-0408" target="_blank"&gt;new technique&lt;/a&gt; for analyzing these interactions at large scales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, most existing tools for studying the immune system were designed to allow for the study of a large pool of antigens exposed to one T cell (or B cell), or a large pool of immune cells encountering a small number of antigens. Birnbaum’s new method uses engineered viruses to present many different antigens to huge populations of immune cells, allowing researchers to screen huge libraries of both antigens and immune cells at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The immune system works with millions of unique T cell receptors in each of us, and billions of possible antigen targets,” Birnbaum says. “In order to be able to really understand the immune system at scale, we spend a lot of time trying to build tools that can work at similar scales.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could enable researchers to eventually screen thousands of antigens against an entire population of B cells and T cells from an individual, which could reveal why some people naturally fight off certain viruses, such as HIV, better than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method, Birnbaum also hopes to develop ways to reprogram T cells inside a patient’s body. Currently, T cell reprogramming requires T cells to be removed from a patient, genetically altered, and then reinfused into the patient. All of these steps could be skipped if instead the T cells were reprogrammed using the same viruses that Birnbaum’s screening technology uses. A company called Kelonia, co-founded by Birnbaum, is also working toward this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To model T cell interactions at even larger scales, Birnbaum is now working with collaborators around the world to use artificial intelligence to make computational predictions of T cell-antigen interactions. The research team, which Birnbaum is leading, includes 12 labs from five countries, funded by Cancer Grand Challenges. The researchers hope to build predictive models that may help them design engineered T cells that could help treat many different diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The program is put together with a focus on whether these types of predictions are possible, but if they are, it could lead to much better understanding of what immunotherapies may work with different people. It could lead to personalized vaccine design, and it could lead to personalized T cell therapy design,” Birnbaum says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A new way to spot life-threatening infections in cancer patients</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Leuko, founded by a research team at MIT, is giving doctors a noninvasive way to monitor cancer patients’ health during chemotherapy — no blood tests needed.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy and other treatments that take down cancer cells can also destroy patients’ immune cells. Every year, that leads tens of thousands of cancer patients with weakened immune systems&amp;nbsp;to contract infections that can turn deadly if unmanaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors must strike a balance between giving enough chemotherapy to eradicate cancer while not giving so much that the patient’s white blood cell count gets dangerously low, a condition known as neutropenia. It can also leave patients socially isolated in between rounds of chemotherapy. Currently, the only way for doctors to monitor their patients’ white blood cells is through blood tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Leuko&amp;nbsp;is developing an at-home white blood cell monitor to give doctors a more complete&amp;nbsp;view of their patients’ health remotely. Rather than drawing blood, the device uses light to look through the skin at the&amp;nbsp;top of the fingernail, and artificial intelligence to analyze and detect when white blood cells reach dangerously low levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology was first conceived of by researchers at MIT in 2015. Over the next few years, they developed a prototype and conducted a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/monitor-detects-dangerously-low-white-blood-cell-levels-0402" target="_blank"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; to validate their approach. Today, Leuko’s devices have accurately detected low white blood cell counts in hundreds of cancer patients, all without drawing a single drop of blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect this to bring a clear improvement in the way that patients are monitored and cared for in the outpatient setting,” says Leuko co-founder and CTO Ian Butterworth, a former research engineer in MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics. “I also think there’s a more personal side of this for patients. These people can feel vulnerable around other people, and they don't currently have much they can do. That means that if they want to see their grandkids or see family, they’re constantly wondering, ‘Am I at high risk?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has been working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the last four years to design studies confirming their device is accurate and easy to use by untrained patients. Later this year, they expect to begin a pivotal study that will be used to register for FDA approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the device becomes an established tool for patient monitoring, Leuko’s team believes it could also give doctors a new way to optimize cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of the physicians that we have talked to are very excited because they think future versions of our product could be used to personalize the dose of chemotherapy&amp;nbsp;given to each patient,” says Leuko co-founder and CEO Carlos Castro-Gonzalez, a former postdoc at MIT. “If a patient is not becoming neutropenic, that could be a sign that you could increase the dose. Then every treatment could be based on how each patient is individually reacting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring immune health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leuko co-founders Ian Butterworth, Carlos Castro-Gonzalez, Aurélien Bourquard, and Alvaro Sanchez-Ferro came to MIT in 2013 as part of the Madrid-MIT M+Vision Consortium, which was a collaboration between MIT and Madrid and is now part of MIT linQ. The program brought biomedical researchers from around the world to MIT to work on translational projects with institutions around Boston and Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program, which was originally run out of MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics, challenged members to tackle huge unmet needs&amp;nbsp;in medicine and connected them with MIT faculty members from across the Institute to build solutions. Leuko’s founders also received support from MIT’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, including the Venture Mentoring Service, the Sandbox Innovation Fund, the Martin Trust Center for Entrepreneurship, and the Deshpande Center. After its MIT spinout, the company raised seed and series A financing rounds led by Good Growth Capital and HTH VC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t even realize that entrepreneurship was a career option for a PhD [like myself],” Castro-Gonzalez says. “I was thinking that after the fellowship I would apply for faculty positions. That was the career path I had in mind, so I was very excited about the focus at MIT on trying to translate science into products that people can benefit from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leuko’s founders knew people with cancer stood to benefit the most from a noninvasive white blood cell monitor. Unless patients go to the hospital, they can currently monitor only their temperature from home. If they show signs of a fever, they’re advised to go to the emergency room immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These infections happen quite frequently,” Sanchez-Ferro&amp;nbsp;says. “One in every six cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy will develop an infection where their white blood cells are critically low. Some of those infections unfortunately end in deaths for patients, which is particularly terrible because they’re due to the treatment rather than the disease. [Infections] also mean the chemotherapy gets interrupted, which increases negative clinical outcomes for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leuko’s optical device works through imaging the capillaries, or small blood vessels, just above the fingernail, which are more visible and already used by doctors to assess other aspects of vascular health. The company’s portable device analyzes white blood cell activity to detect critically low levels for care teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajh.25516" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 44 patients in 2019, Leuko’s team showed the approach was able to detect when white blood cell levels dropped below a critical threshold, with minimal false positives. The team has since developed a product that another, larger study &lt;a href="https://www.jmir.org/2022/8/e37368" target="_blank"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; unsupervised patients can use at home to get immune information to doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We work completely noninvasively, so you can perform white blood cell measurements at home and much more frequently than what’s possible today,” Bourquard&amp;nbsp;says. “The key aspect of this is it allows doctors to identify patients whose immune systems become so weak they’re at high risk of infection. If doctors have that information, they can provide preventative treatment in the form of antibiotics and growth factors. Research estimates that would eliminate 50 percent of hospitalizations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leuko’s founders believe their device will help physicians make more informed care decisions for patients. They also believe the device holds promise for monitoring patient health across other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term vision for the company is making this available to other patient populations that can also benefit from increased monitoring of their immune system,” Castro-Gonzalez says. “That includes patients with multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, organ transplants, and patients that are rushed into the emergency room.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leuko’s team even sees a future where their device could be used to monitor other biomarkers in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe this could be a platform technology,” Castro-Gonzalez says. “We get these noninvasive videos of the blood flowing through the capillaries, so part of the vision for the company is measuring other parameters in the blood beyond white blood cells, including hemoglobin, red blood cells, and platelets. That’s all part of our roadmap for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human genome contains about 23,000 genes, but only a fraction of those genes are turned on inside a cell at any given time. The complex network of regulatory elements that controls gene expression includes regions of the genome called enhancers, which are often located far from the genes that they regulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distance can make it difficult to map the complex interactions between genes and enhancers. To overcome that, MIT researchers have invented a new technique that allows them to observe the timing of gene and enhancer activation in a cell. When a gene is turned on around the same time as a particular enhancer, it strongly suggests the enhancer is controlling that gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning more about which enhancers control which genes, in different types of cells, could help researchers identify potential drug targets for genetic disorders. Genomic studies have identified mutations in many non-protein-coding regions that are linked to a variety of diseases. Could these be unknown enhancers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people start using genetic technology to identify regions of chromosomes that have disease information, most of those sites don’t correspond to genes. We suspect they correspond to these enhancers, which can be quite distant from a promoter, so it’s very important to be able to identify these enhancers,” says Phillip Sharp, an MIT Institute Professor Emeritus and member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharp is the senior author of the new study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07517-7" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. MIT Research Assistant D.B. Jay Mahat is the lead author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting for eRNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than 2&amp;nbsp;percent of the human genome consists of protein-coding genes.&amp;nbsp;The rest of the genome includes many elements that control when and how those genes are expressed. Enhancers, which are thought to turn genes on by coming into physical contact with gene promoter regions through transiently forming a complex, were discovered about 45 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, in 2010, researchers discovered that these enhancers are transcribed into RNA molecules, known as enhancer RNA or eRNA. Scientists suspect that this transcription occurs when the enhancers are actively interacting with their target genes. This raised the possibility that measuring eRNA transcription levels could help researchers determine when an enhancer is active, as well as which genes it’s targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That information is extraordinarily important in understanding how development occurs, and in understanding how cancers change their regulatory programs and activate processes that lead to de-differentiation and metastatic growth,” Mahat says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this kind of mapping has proven difficult to perform because eRNA is produced in very small quantities and does not last long in the cell. Additionally, eRNA lacks a modification known as a poly-A tail, which is the “hook” that most techniques use to pull RNA out of a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to capture eRNA is to add a nucleotide to cells that halts transcription when incorporated into RNA. These nucleotides also contain a tag called biotin that can be used to fish the RNA out of a cell. However, this current technique only works on large pools of cells and doesn’t give information about individual cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While brainstorming ideas for new ways to capture eRNA, Mahat and Sharp considered using click chemistry, a technique that can be used to join two molecules together if they are each tagged with “click handles” that can react together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed nucleotides labeled with one click handle, and once these nucleotides are incorporated into growing eRNA strands, the strands can be fished out with a tag containing the complementary handle. This allowed the researchers to capture eRNA and then purify, amplify, and sequence it. Some RNA is lost at each step, but Mahat estimates that they can successfully pull out about 10 percent of the eRNA from a given cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this technique, the researchers obtained a snapshot of the enhancers and genes that are being actively transcribed at a given time in a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to be able to determine, in every cell, the activation of transcription from regulatory elements and from their corresponding gene. And this has to be done in a single cell because that’s where you can detect synchrony or asynchrony between regulatory elements and genes,” Mahat says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing of gene expression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstrating their technique in mouse embryonic stem cells, the researchers found that they could calculate approximately when a particular region starts to be transcribed, based on the length of the RNA strand and the speed of the polymerase (the enzyme responsible for transcription) — that is, how far the polymerase transcribes per second. This allowed them to determine which genes and enhancers were being transcribed around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used this approach to determine the timing of the expression of cell cycle genes in more detail than has previously been possible. They were also able to confirm several sets of known gene-enhancer pairs and generated a list of about 50,000 possible enhancer-gene pairs that they can now try to verify.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning which enhancers control which genes would prove valuable in developing new treatments for diseases with a genetic basis. Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first gene therapy treatment for sickle cell anemia, which works by interfering with an enhancer that results in activation of a fetal globin gene, reducing the production of sickled blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT team is now applying this approach to other types of cells, with a focus on autoimmune diseases. Working with researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital, they are exploring immune cell mutations that have been linked to lupus, many of which are found in non-coding regions of the genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not clear which genes are affected by these mutations, so we are beginning to tease apart the genes these putative enhancers might be regulating, and in what cell types these enhancers are active,” Mahat says. “This is a tool for creating gene-to-enhancer maps, which are fundamental in understanding the biology, and also a foundation for understanding disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study also offer evidence for a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/gene-control-dna-protein-droplets-0808" target="_blank"&gt;theory&lt;/a&gt; that Sharp has recently developed, along with MIT professors Richard Young and Arup Chakraborty,&amp;nbsp;that gene transcription is controlled by membraneless droplets known as condensates. These condensates are made of large clusters of enzymes and RNA, which Sharp suggests may include eRNA produced at enhancer sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We picture that the communication between an enhancer and a promoter is a condensate-type, transient structure, and RNA is part of that. This is an important piece of work in building the understanding of how RNAs from enhancers could be active,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health, and the Emerald Foundation Postdoctoral Transition Award.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A newly complete database of human protein kinases and their preferred binding sites provides a powerful new platform to investigate cell signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Culminating 25 years of research, MIT, Harvard University, and Yale University scientists and collaborators have unveiled a comprehensive atlas of human tyrosine kinases — enzymes that regulate a wide variety of cellular activities — and their binding sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of tyrosine kinases to a previously published &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05575-3"&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; from the same group now completes a free, publicly available &lt;a href="https://scansite4.mit.edu/#home"&gt;atlas&lt;/a&gt; of all human kinases and their specific binding sites on proteins, which together orchestrate fundamental cell processes such as growth, cell division, and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers can use data from mass spectrometry, a common laboratory technique, to identify the kinases involved in normal and dysregulated cell signaling in human tissue, such as during inflammation or cancer progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am most excited about being able to apply this to individual patients’ tumors and learn about the signaling states of cancer and heterogeneity of that signaling,” says Michael Yaffe, who is the David H. Koch Professor of Science at MIT, the director of the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and a senior author of the new study. “This could reveal new druggable targets or novel combination therapies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07407-y" target="_blank"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is the product of a long-standing collaboration with senior authors Lewis Cantley at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Benjamin Turk at Yale School of Medicine, and Jared Johnson at Weill Cornell Medical College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s lead authors are Tomer Yaron-Barir at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and MIT’s Brian Joughin, with contributions from Kontstantin Krismer, Mina Takegami, and Pau Creixell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kinase kingdom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cells are governed by a network of diverse protein kinases that alter the properties of other proteins by adding or removing chemical compounds called phosphate groups. Phosphate groups are small but powerful: When attached to proteins, they can turn proteins on or off, or even dramatically change their function. Identifying which of the almost 400 human kinases phosphorylate a specific protein at a particular site on the protein was traditionally a lengthy, laborious process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the mid 1990s, the Cantley laboratory developed a method using a library of small peptides to identify the optimal amino acid sequence — called a motif, similar to a scannable barcode — that a kinase targets on its substrate proteins for the addition of a phosphate group. Over the ensuing years, Yaffe, Turk, and Johnson, all of whom spent time as postdocs in the Cantley lab, made seminal advancements in the technique, increasing its throughput, accuracy, and utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson led a massive experimental effort exposing batches of kinases to these peptide libraries and observed which kinases phosphorylated which subsets of peptides. In a corresponding &lt;em&gt;Nature&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ki.mit.edu/people/faculty/michael-yaffe"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in January 2023, the team mapped more than 300 serine/threonine kinases, the other main type of protein kinase, to their motifs. In the current paper, they complete the human “kinome” by successfully mapping 93 tyrosine kinases to their corresponding motifs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, by creating and using advanced computational tools, Yaron-Barir, Krismer, Joughin, Takegami, and Yaffe tested whether the results were predictive of real proteins, and whether the results might reveal unknown signaling events in normal and cancer cells. By analyzing phosphoproteomic data from mass spectrometry to reveal phosphorylation patterns in cells, their atlas accurately predicted tyrosine kinase activity in previously studied cell signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, using recently published phosphoproteomic data of human lung cancer cells treated with two targeted drugs, the atlas identified that treatment with erlotinib, a known inhibitor of the protein EGFR, downregulated sites matching a motif for EGFR. Treatment with afatinib, a known HER2 inhibitor, downregulated sites matching the HER2 motif. Unexpectedly, afatinib treatment also upregulated the motif for the tyrosine kinase MET, a finding that helps explain patient data linking MET activity to afatinib drug resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two key ways researchers can use the new atlas. First, for a protein of interest that is being phosphorylated, the atlas can be used to narrow down hundreds of kinases to a short list of candidates likely to be involved. “The predictions that come from using this will still need to be validated experimentally, but it’s a huge step forward in making clear predictions that can be tested,” says Yaffe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the atlas makes phosphoproteomic data more useful and actionable. In the past, researchers might gather phosphoproteomic data from a tissue sample, but it was difficult to know what that data was saying or how to best use it to guide next steps in research. Now, that data can be used to predict which kinases are upregulated or downregulated and therefore which cellular signaling pathways are active or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We now have a new tool now to interpret those large datasets, a Rosetta Stone for phosphoproteomics,” says Yaffe. “It is going to be particularly helpful for turning this type of disease data into actionable items.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the context of cancer, phosophoproteomic data from a patient’s tumor biopsy could be used to help doctors quickly identify which kinases and cell signaling pathways are involved in cancer expansion or drug resistance, then use that knowledge to target those pathways with appropriate drug therapy or combination therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaffe’s lab and their colleagues at the National Institutes of Health are now using the atlas to seek out new insights into difficult cancers, including appendiceal cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. While many cancers have been shown to have a strong genetic component, such as the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2&amp;nbsp;in breast cancer, other cancers are not associated with any known genetic cause. “We’re using this atlas to interrogate these tumors that don’t seem to have a clear genetic driver to see if we can identify kinases that are driving cancer progression,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to completing the human kinase atlas, the team made two biological discoveries in their recent study. First, they identified three main classes of phosphorylation motifs, or barcodes, for tyrosine kinases. The first class is motifs that map to multiple kinases, suggesting that numerous signaling pathways converge to phosphorylate a protein boasting that motif. The second class is motifs with a one-to-one match between motif and kinase, in which only a specific kinase will activate a protein with that motif. This came as a partial surprise, as tyrosine kinases have been thought to have minimal specificity by some in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final class includes motifs for which there is no clear match to one of the 78 classical tyrosine kinases. This class includes motifs that match to 15 atypical tyrosine kinases known to also phosphorylate serine or threonine residues. “This means that there’s a subset of kinases that we didn’t recognize that are actually playing an important role,” says Yaffe. It also indicates there may be other mechanisms besides motifs alone that affect how a kinase interacts with a protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered that tyrosine kinase motifs are tightly conserved between humans and the worm species &lt;em&gt;C. elegans,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;despite the species being separated by more than 600 million years of evolution. In other words, a worm kinase and its human homologue are phosphorylating essentially the same motif. That sequence preservation suggests that tyrosine kinases are highly critical to signaling pathways in all multicellular organisms, and any small change would be harmful to an organism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Charles and Marjorie Holloway Foundation, the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via L. Scott Ritterbush, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the National Institutes of Health, Cancer Research UK, the Brain Tumour Charity, and the Koch Institute Support (core) grant from the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <description><![CDATA[Senior Hanjun Lee planned to pursue chemistry at MIT. A course in genetics changed that.<br>

        <dc:creator>Lillian Eden | Department of Biology</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When Hanjun Lee arrived at MIT, he was set on becoming a Course 5 chemistry student. Based on his experience in high school, biology was all about rote memorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That changed when he took course&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/7/#:~:text=7.03%20Genetics&amp;amp;text=The%20principles%20of%20genetics%20with,recombination%2C%20mutation%2C%20and%20selection." target="_blank"&gt;7.03 (Genetics)&lt;/a&gt;, taught by then-professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/aviv-regev" target="_blank"&gt;Aviv Regev&lt;/a&gt;, now head and executive vice president of research and early development at Genentech, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://biology.mit.edu/profile/peter-reddien/" target="_blank"&gt;Peter Reddien&lt;/a&gt;, professor of biology and core member and associate director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He notes that friends from other schools don’t cite a single course that changed their major, but he’s not alone in choosing Course 7 because of 7.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Genetics has this interesting force, especially in MIT biology. The department’s historical — and active — role in genetics research ties directly into the way the course is taught,” Lee says. “Biology is about logic, scientific reasoning, and posing the right questions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A few years later, as a teaching assistant for class&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://catalog.mit.edu/subjects/7/#:~:text=7.002%20Fundamentals%20of%20Experimental%20Molecular%20Biology&amp;amp;text=Introduces%20the%20experimental%20concepts%20and,units%20of%20Institute%20Laboratory%20credit." target="_blank"&gt;7.002 (Fundamentals of Experimental Molecular Biology&lt;/a&gt;), he came to value how much care MIT biology professors take in presenting the material for all offered courses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I really appreciate how much effort MIT professors put into their teaching,” Lee says. “As a TA, you realize the beauty of how the professors organize these things — because they’re teaching you in a specific way, and you can grasp the beauty of it — there’s a beauty in studying and finding the patterns in nature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An undertaking to apply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To attend MIT at all hadn’t exactly been a lifelong dream. In fact, it didn’t occur to Lee that he could or should apply until he represented South Korea at the 49th International Chemistry Olympiad, where he won a Gold Medal in 2017. There, he had the chance to speak with MIT alumni, as well as current and aspiring students. More than half of those aspiring students eventually enrolled, Lee among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Before that, MIT was this nearly mythical institution, so that experience really changed my life,” Lee recalls. “I heard so many different stories from people with so many different backgrounds — all converging towards the same enthusiasm towards science.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At the time, Lee was already attending medical school — a six-year undergraduate program in Korea — that would lead to a stable career in medicine. Attending MIT would involve both changing his career plans and uprooting his life, leaving all his friends and family behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His parents weren’t especially enthusiastic about his desire to study at MIT, so it was up to Lee to meet the application requirements. He woke up at 3 a.m. to find his own way to the only SAT testing site in South Korea — an undertaking he now recalls with a laugh. In just three months, he had gathered everything he needed; MIT was the only institution in the United States Lee applied to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He arrived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2018 but attended MIT only for a semester before returning to Korea for his two years of mandatory military service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“During military service, my goal was to read as many papers as possible, because I wondered what topic of science I’m drawn to — and many of the papers I was reading were authored by people I recognized, people who taught biology at MIT,” Lee says. “I became really interested in cancer biology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return to MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When he returned to campus, Lee pledged to do everything he could to meet with faculty and discuss their work. To that end, he joined the &lt;em&gt;MIT Undergraduate Research Journal&lt;/em&gt;, allowing him to interview professors. He notes that most MIT faculty are enthusiastic about being contacted by undergraduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Stateside, Lee also reached out to &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/cancer-center/clinical-trials-and-research/center-for-cancer-research/investigators/lawrence-lab" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Lawrence&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School and assistant geneticist at Mass General Cancer Center, about a preprint concerning APOBEC, an enzyme Lee had studied at Seoul National University. Lawrence’s lab was looking into APOBEC and cancer evolution — and the idea that the enzyme might drive drug resistance to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Since he joined my lab, I’ve been absolutely amazed by his scientific talents,” Lawrence says. “Hanjun’s scientific maturity and achievements are extremely rare, especially in an undergraduate student.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lee has made new discoveries from genomic data and was involved in publishing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35981542/" target="_blank"&gt;a paper in &lt;em&gt;Molecular Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01594-6" target="_blank"&gt;a paper in &lt;em&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the latter, the lab identified the source of background noise in chromosome conformation capture experiments, a technique for analyzing chromatin in cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lawrence thinks Lee “is destined for great leadership in science.” In the meantime, Lee has gained valuable insights into how much work these types of achievements require.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Doing research has been rewarding, but it also taught me to appreciate that science is almost 100 percent about failures,” Lee says. “It is those failures that end up leading you to the path of success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widening the scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Lee’s personal motto is that to excel in a specific field, one must have a broad sense of what the entire field looks like, and suggests other budding scientists enroll in courses distant from their research area. He also says it was key to see his peers as collaborators rather than competitors, and that each student will excel in their own unique way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Your MIT experience is defined by interactions with others,” Lee says. “They will help identify and shape your path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For his accomplishments, Lee was recently named an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.aacr.org/governance/hanjun-lee/" target="_blank"&gt;American Association for Cancer Research Undergraduate Scholar&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, he also spoke at the Gordon Research Conference on Cell Growth and Proliferation about his work on the retinoblastoma gene product RB. Lee was also among the 2024 Biology Undergraduate Award Winners, recognized with the Salvador E. Luria Prize for outstanding scholarship and research of publication quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Encouraged by positive course evaluations during his time as a TA, Lee hopes to inspire other students in the future through teaching. Lee has recently decided to pursue a PhD in cancer biology at Harvard Medical School, although his interests remain broad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I want to explore other fields of biology as well,” he says. “I have so many questions that I want to answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Although initially resistant, Lee’s mother and father are now “immensely proud to be MIT parents” and will be coming to Cambridge in May to celebrate Lee’s graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Throughout my years here, they’ve been able to see how I’ve changed,” he says. “I don’t think I’m a great scientist, yet, but I now have some sense of how to become one.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>From steel engineering to ovarian tumor research</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ashutosh Kumar is a classically trained materials engineer. Having grown up with a passion for making things, he has explored steel design and studied stress fractures in alloys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Kumar’s education, however, he was also drawn to biology and medicine. When he was accepted into an undergraduate metallurgical engineering and materials science program at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, the native of Jamshedpur was very excited — and “a little dissatisfied, since I couldn’t do biology anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a PhD candidate and a &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/students/graduate-student-fellowships/mathworks-fellows/" target="_blank"&gt;MathWorks Fellow&lt;/a&gt; in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and a researcher for the Koch Institute, Kumar can merge his wide-ranging interests. He studies the effect of certain bacteria that have been observed encouraging the spread of ovarian cancer and possibly reducing the effectiveness of chemotherapy and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some microbes have an affinity toward infecting ovarian cancer cells, which can lead to changes in the cellular structure and reprogramming cells to survive in stressful conditions,” Kumar says. “This means that cells can migrate to different sites and may have a mechanism to develop chemoresistance. This opens an avenue to develop therapies to see if we can start to undo some of these changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar’s research combines microbiology, bioengineering, artificial intelligence, big data, and materials science. Using microbiome sequencing and AI, he aims to define microbiome changes that may correlate with poor patient outcomes. Ultimately, his goal is to engineer bacteriophage viruses to reprogram bacteria to work therapeutically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar started inching toward work in the health sciences just months into earning his bachelor's degree at IIT Bombay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized engineering is so flexible that its applications extend to any field,” he says, adding that he started working with biomaterials “to respect both my degree program and my interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I loved it so much that I decided to go to graduate school,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting his PhD program at MIT, he says, “was a fantastic opportunity to switch gears and work on more interdisciplinary or ‘MIT-type’ work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar says he and Angela Belcher, the James Mason Crafts Professor of biological engineering, materials science and of the Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer Research, began discussing the impact of the microbiome on ovarian cancer when he first arrived at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I shared my enthusiasm about human health and biology, and we started brainstorming,” he says. “We realized that there’s an unmet need to understand a lot of gynecological cancers. Ovarian cancer is an aggressive cancer, which is usually diagnosed when it’s too late and has already spread.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Kumar was awarded a MathWorks Fellowship. The fellowships are awarded to School of Engineering graduate students, preferably those who use MATLAB or Simulink — which were developed by the mathematical computer software company MathWorks — in their research. The philanthropic support fueled Kumar’s full transition into health science research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The work we are doing now was initially not funded by traditional sources, and the MathWorks Fellowship gave us the flexibility to pursue this field,” Kumar says. “It provided me with opportunities to learn new skills and ask questions about this topic. MathWorks gave me a chance to explore my interests and helped me navigate from being a steel engineer to a cancer scientist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar’s work on the relationship between bacteria and ovarian cancer started with studying which bacteria are incorporated into tumors in mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We started looking closely at changes in cell structure and how those changes impact cancer progression,” he says, adding that MATLAB image processing helps him and his collaborators track tumor metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team also uses RNA sequencing and MATLAB algorithms to construct a taxonomy of the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we have identified the microbiome composition,” Kumar says, “we want to see how the microbiome changes as cancer progresses and identify changes in, let’s say, patients who develop chemoresistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says recent findings that ovarian cancer may originate in the fallopian tubes are promising because detecting cancer-related biomarkers or lesions before cancer spreads to the ovaries could lead to better prognoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he pursues his research, Kumar says he is extremely thankful to Belcher “for believing in me to work on this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She trusted me and my passion for making an impact on human health — even though I come from a materials engineering background — and supported me throughout. It was her passion to take on new challenges that made it possible for me to work on this idea. She has been an amazing mentor and motivated me to continue moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her part, Belcher is equally enthralled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been amazing to work with Ashutosh on this ovarian cancer microbiome project," she says. "He has been so passionate and dedicated to looking for less-conventional approaches to solve this debilitating disease. His innovations around looking for very early changes in the microenvironment of this disease could be critical in interception and prevention of ovarian cancer. We started this project with very little preliminary data, so his MathWorks fellowship was critical in the initiation of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kumar, who has been very active in student government and community-building activities, believes it is very important for students to feel included and at home at their institutions so they can develop in ways outside of academics. He says that his own involvement helps him take time off from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Science can never stop, and there will always be something to do,” he says, explaining that he deliberately schedules time off and that social engagement helps him to experience downtime. “Engaging with community members through events on campus or at the dorm helps set a mental boundary with work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding his unusual route through materials science to cancer research, Kumar regards it as something that occurred organically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have observed that life is very dynamic,” he says. “What we think we might do versus what we end up doing is never consistent. Five years back, I had no idea I would be at MIT working with such excellent scientific mentors around me.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>A closed-loop drug-delivery system could improve chemotherapy</title>

  <description><![CDATA[New CLAUDIA system could continuously monitor patients during an infusion and adjust dosage to maintain optimal drug levels.  ]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When cancer patients undergo chemotherapy, the dose of most drugs is calculated based on the patient’s body surface area. This is estimated by plugging the patient’s height and weight into an equation, dating to 1916, that was formulated from data on just nine patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simplistic dosing doesn’t take into account other factors and can lead to patients receiving either too much or too little of a drug. As a result, some patients likely experience avoidable toxicity or insufficient benefit from the chemotherapy they receive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make chemotherapy dosing more accurate, MIT engineers have come up with an alternative approach that can enable the dose to be personalized to the patient. Their system measures how much drug is in the patient’s system, and these measurements are fed into a controller that can adjust the infusion rate accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach could help to compensate for differences in drug pharmacokinetics caused by body composition, genetic makeup, chemotherapy-induced toxicity of the organs that metabolize the drugs, interactions with other medications being taken and foods consumed, and circadian fluctuations in the enzymes responsible for breaking down chemotherapy drugs, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Recognizing the advances in our understanding of how drugs are metabolized, and applying engineering tools to facilitate personalized dosing, we believe, can help transform the safety and efficacy of many drugs,” says Giovanni Traverso, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis DeRidder, an MIT graduate student, is the lead author of the &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/med/abstract/S2666-6340(24)00132-6" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Med&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers focused on a drug called 5-fluorouracil, which is used to treat colorectal cancers, among others. The drug is typically infused over a 46-hour period, and the dosage is determined using a formula based on the patient’s height and weight, which gives the estimated body surface area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that approach doesn’t account for differences in body composition that can affect how the drug spreads through the body, or genetic variations that influence how it is metabolized. Those differences can lead to harmful side effects, if too much drug is present. If not enough drug is circulating, it may not kill the tumor as expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People with the same body surface area could have very different heights and weights, could have very different muscle masses or genetics, but as long as the height and the weight plugged into this equation give the same body surface area, their dose is identical,” says DeRidder, a PhD candidate in the Medical Engineering and Medical Physics program within the Harvard-MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor that can alter the amount of drug in the bloodstream at any given time is circadian fluctuations of an enzyme called dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which breaks down 5-fluorouracil. DPD’s expression, like many other enzymes in the body, is regulated on a circadian rhythm. Thus, the degradation of 5-FU by DPD is not constant but changes according to the time of the day. These circadian rhythms can lead to tenfold fluctuations in the amount of 5-fluorouracil in a patient’s bloodstream over the course of an infusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Using body surface area to calculate a chemotherapy dose, we know that two people can have profoundly different toxicity from 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. Looking at one patient, they can have cycles of treatment with minimal toxicity and then have a cycle with miserable toxicity. Something changed in how that patient metabolized chemo from one cycle to the next. Our antiquated dosing fails to capture that change, and patients suffer as a result,” says Douglas Rubinson, a clinical oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to try to counteract the variability in chemotherapy pharmacokinetics is a strategy called therapeutic drug monitoring, in which the patient gives a blood sample at the end of one treatment cycle. After this sample is analyzed for the drug concentration, the dosage can be adjusted, if needed, at the beginning of the next cycle (usually two weeks later for 5-fluorouracil). This approach has been shown to result in better outcomes for patients, but it is not widely used for chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers wanted to develop a similar type of monitoring, but in a manner that is automated and enables real-time drug personalization, which could result in better outcomes for patients. In their “closed-loop” system, drug concentrations can be continually monitored, and that information is used to automatically adjust the infusion rate of the chemotherapy drug and keep the dose within the target range. Such a closed-loop system enables personalization of the drug dose in a manner that considers circadian rhythm changes in the levels of drug-metabolizing enzymes, as well as any changes in the patient’s pharmacokinetics since their last treatment, such as chemotherapy-induced toxicity of the organs that metabolize the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new system they designed, known as CLAUDIA (Closed-Loop AUtomated Drug Infusion regulAtor), makes use of commercially available equipment for each step. Blood samples are taken every five minutes and rapidly prepared for analysis. The concentration of 5-fluorouracil in the blood is measured and compared to the target range. The difference between the target and measured concentration is input to a control algorithm, which then adjusts the infusion rate if necessary, to keep the dose within the range of concentrations between which the drug is effective and nontoxic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve developed is a system where you can constantly measure the concentration of drug and adjust the infusion rate accordingly, to keep the drug concentration within the therapeutic window,” DeRidder says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid adjustment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In tests in animals, the researchers found that using CLAUDIA, they could keep the amount of drug circulating in the body within the target range around 45 percent of the time. Drug levels in animals that received chemotherapy without CLAUDIA remained in the target range only 13 percent of the time, on average. In this study, the researchers did not do any tests of the effectiveness of the drug levels, but keeping the concentration within the target window is believed to lead to better outcomes and less toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CLAUDIA was also able to keep the dose of 5-fluorouracil within the target range even when the researchers administered a drug that inhibits the DPD enzyme. In animals that received this inhibitor without continuous monitoring and adjustment, levels of 5-fluorouracil increased by up to eightfold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this demonstration, the researchers manually performed each step of the process, using off-the-shelf equipment, but they now plan to work on automating each step so that the monitoring and dose adjustment can be done without any human intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To measure drug concentrations, the researchers used high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (HPLC-MS), a technique that could be adapted to detect nearly any type of drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We foresee a future where we’re able to use CLAUDIA for any drug that has the right pharmacokinetic properties and is detectable with HPLC-MS, thereby enabling the personalization of dosing for many different drugs,” DeRidder says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program, a MathWorks Fellowship, MIT’s Karl van Tassel Career Development Professorship, the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, and the Bridge Project, a partnership between the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Improving drug development with a vast map of the immune system</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/immunai-improving-drug-development-with-immune-system-map-0411</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Immunai’s founders were researchers at MIT when they launched their company to help predict how patients will respond to new treatments.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>
    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/immunai-improving-drug-development-with-immune-system-map-0411</guid>
        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human immune system is a network made up of trillions of cells that are constantly circulating throughout the body. The cellular network orchestrates interactions with every organ and tissue to carry out an impossibly long list of functions that scientists are still working to understand. All that complexity limits our ability to predict which patients will respond to treatments and which ones might suffer debilitating side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue often leads pharmaceutical companies to stop developing drugs that could help certain patients, halting clinical trials even when drugs show promising results for some people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Immunai is helping to predict how patients will respond to treatments by building a comprehensive map of the immune system. The company has assembled a vast database it calls AMICA, that combines multiple layers of gene and protein expression data in cells with clinical trial data to match the right drugs to the right patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our starting point was creating what I call the Google Maps for the immune system,” Immunai co-founder and CEO Noam Solomon says. “We started with single-cell RNA sequencing, and over time we’ve added more and more ‘omics’: genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, all to measure the immune system’s cellular expression and function, to measure the immune environment holistically. Then we started working with pharmaceutical companies and hospitals to profile the immune systems of patients undergoing treatments to really get to the root mechanisms of action and resistance for therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunai’s big data foundation is a result of its founders’ unique background. Solomon and co-founder Luis Voloch ’13, SM ’15 hold degrees in mathematics and computer science. In fact, Solomon was a postdoc in MIT’s Department of Mathematics at the time of Immunai’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solomon frames Immunai’s mission as stopping the decades-long divergence of computer science and the life sciences. He believes the single biggest factor driving the explosion of computing has been Moore’s Law — our ability to exponentially increase the number of transistors on a chip over the past 60 years. In the pharmaceutical industry, the reverse is happening: By &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd3681" target="_blank"&gt;one estimate&lt;/a&gt;, the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubles every nine years. The phenomenon has been dubbed Eroom’s Law (“Eroom” for “Moore” spelled backward).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solomon sees the trend eroding the case for developing new drugs, with huge consequences for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Why&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;should pharmaceutical companies invest in discovery if they won’t get a return on investment?” Solomon asks. “Today, there’s only a 5 to 10 percent chance that any given clinical trial will be successful. What we’ve built through a very robust and granular mapping of the immune system is a chance to improve the preclinical and clinical stages of drug development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A change in plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solomon entered Tel Aviv University when he was 14 and earned his bachelor’s degree in computer science by 19. He earned two PhDs in Israel, one in computer science and the other in mathematics, before coming to MIT in 2017 as a postdoc to continue his mathematical research career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That year Solomon met Voloch, who had already earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in math and computer science from MIT. But the researchers were soon exposed to a problem that would take them out of their comfort zones and change the course of their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voloch’s grandfather was receiving a cocktail of treatments for cancer at the time. The cancer went into remission, but he suffered terrible side effects that caused him to stop taking his medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voloch and Solomon began wondering if their expertise could help patients like Voloch’s grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we realized we could make an impact, we made the difficult decision to stop our academic pursuits and start a new journey,” Solomon recalls. “That was the starting point for Immunai.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voloch and Solomon soon partnered with Immunai scientific co-founders Ansu Satpathy, a researcher at Stanford University at the time, and Danny Wells, a researcher at the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Satpathy and Wells had shown that single-cell RNA sequencing could be used to gain insights into why patients respond differently to a common cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team began analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data published in scientific papers, trying to link common biomarkers with patient outcomes. Then they integrated data from the United Kingdom’s Biobank public health database, finding they were able to improve their models’ predictions. Soon they were incorporating data from hospitals, academic research institutions, and pharmaceutical companies, analyzing information about the structure, function, and environment of cells — multiomics — to get a clearer picture of immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Single cell sequencing gives you metrics you can measure in thousands of cells, where you can look at 20,000 different genes, and those metrics give you an immune profile,” Solomon explains. “When you measure all of that over time, especially before and after getting therapy, and compare patients who do respond with patients who don’t, you can apply machine learning models to understand why.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those data and models make up AMICA, what Immunai calls the world’s largest cell-level immune knowledge base. AMICA stands for Annotated Multiomic Immune Cell Atlas. It analyzes single cell multiomic data from almost 10,000 patients and bulk-RNA data from 100,000 patients across more than 800 cell types and 500 diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the core of Immunai’s approach is a focus on the immune system, which other companies shy away from because of its complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We don't want to be like other groups that are studying mainly tumor microenvironments,” Solomon says. “We look at the immune system because the immune system is the common denominator. It’s the one system that is implicated in every disease, in your body’s response to everything that you encounter, whether it's a viral infection or bacterial infection or a drug that you are receiving — even how you are aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning data into better treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunai has already partnered with some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world to help them identify promising treatments and set up their clinical trials for success. Immunai's insights can help partners make critical decisions about treatment schedules, dosing, drug combinations, patient selection, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is talking about AI, but I think the most exciting aspect of the platform we have built is the fact that it's vertically integrated, from wet lab to computational modeling with multiple iterations,” Solomon says. “For example, we may do single-cell immune profiling of patient samples, then we upload that data to the cloud and our computational models come up with insights, and with those insights we do in vitro or in vivo validation to see if our models are right and iteratively improve them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately Immunai wants to enable a future where lab experiments can more reliably turn into impactful new recommendations and treatments for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Scientists can cure nearly every type of cancer, but only in mice,” Solomon says. “In preclinical models we know how to cure cancer. In human beings, in most cases, we still don't. To overcome that, most scientists are looking for better ex vivo or in vivo models. Our approach is to be more agnostic as to the model system, but feed the machine with more and more data from multiple model systems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We’re demonstrating that our algorithms can repeatedly beat the top benchmarks in identifying the top preclinical immune features that match to patient outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Paula Hammond first arrived on MIT’s campus as a first-year student in the early 1980s, she wasn’t sure if she belonged. In fact, as she told an MIT audience yesterday, she felt like “an imposter.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that feeling didn’t last long, as Hammond began to find support among her fellow students and MIT’s faculty. “Community was really important for me, to feel that I belonged, to feel that I had a place here, and I found people who were willing to embrace me and support me,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond, a world-renowned chemical engineer who has spent most of her academic career at MIT, made her remarks during the 2023-24 James R. Killian Jr. Faculty Achievement Award lecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Established in 1971 to honor MIT’s 10th president, James Killian, the Killian Award recognizes extraordinary professional achievements by an MIT faculty member. Hammond was chosen for this year’s award “not only for her tremendous professional achievements and contributions, but also for her genuine warmth and humanity, her thoughtfulness and effective leadership, and her empathy and ethics,” according to the award citation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Professor Hammond is a pioneer in nanotechnology research. With a program that extends from basic science to translational research in medicine and energy, she has introduced new approaches for the design and development of complex drug delivery systems for cancer treatment and noninvasive imaging,” said Mary Fuller, chair of MIT’s faculty and a professor of literature, who presented the award. “As her colleagues, we are delighted to celebrate her career today.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January, Hammond began serving as MIT’s vice provost for faculty. Before that, she chaired the Department of Chemical Engineering for eight years, and she was named an Institute Professor in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A versatile technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond, who grew up in Detroit, credits her parents with instilling a love of science. Her father was one of very few Black PhDs in biochemistry at the time, while her mother earned a master’s degree in nursing from Howard University and founded the nursing school at Wayne County Community College. “That provided a huge amount of opportunity for women in the area of Detroit, including women of color,” Hammond noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After earning her bachelor’s degree from MIT in 1984, Hammond worked as an engineer before returning to the Institute as a graduate student, earning her PhD in 1993. After a two-year postdoc at Harvard University, she returned to join the MIT faculty in 1995.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Hammond’s research is a technique she developed to create thin films that can essentially “shrink-wrap” nanoparticles. By tuning the chemical composition of these films, the particles can be customized to deliver drugs or nucleic acids and to target specific cells in the body, including cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make these films, Hammond begins by layering positively charged polymers onto a negatively charged surface. Then, more layers can be added, alternating positively and negatively charged polymers. Each of these layers may contain drugs or other useful molecules, such as DNA or RNA. Some of these films contain hundreds of layers, others just one, making them useful for a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s nice about the layer-by-layer process is I can choose a group of degradable polymers that are nicely biocompatible, and I can alternate them with our drug materials. This means that I can build up thin film layers that contain different drugs at different points within the film,” Hammond said. “Then, when the film degrades, it can release those drugs in reverse order. This is enabling us to create complex, multidrug films, using a simple water-based technique.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond described how these layer-by-layer films can be used to promote bone growth, in an application that could help people born with congenital bone defects or people who experience traumatic injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that use, her lab has created films with layers of two proteins. One of these, BMP-2, is a protein that interacts with adult stem cells and induces them to differentiate into bone cells, generating new bone. The second is a growth factor called VEGF, which stimulates the growth of new blood vessels that help bone to regenerate. These layers are applied to a very thin tissue scaffold that can be implanted at the injury site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond and her students designed the coating so that once implanted, it would release VEGF early, over a week or so, and continue releasing BMP-2 for up to 40 days. In a study of mice, they found that this tissue scaffold stimulated the growth of &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/bone-repair-treat-injuries-0818" target="_blank"&gt;new bone&lt;/a&gt; that was nearly indistinguishable from natural bone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Hammond has also developed layer-by-layer coatings that can improve the performance of nanoparticles used for cancer drug delivery, such as liposomes or nanoparticles made from a polymer called PLGA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have a broad range of drug carriers that we can wrap this way. I think of them like a gobstopper, where there are all those different layers of candy and they dissolve one at a time,” Hammond said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, Hammond has created particles that can deliver a one-two punch to cancer cells. First, the particles release a dose of a nucleic acid such as short interfering RNA (siRNA), which can turn off a cancerous gene, or microRNA, which can activate tumor suppressor genes. Then, the particles release a chemotherapy drug such as cisplatin, to which the cells are now more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The particles also include a negatively charged outer “stealth layer” that protects them from being broken down in the bloodstream before they can reach their targets. This outer layer can also be modified to help the particles get taken up by cancer cells, by incorporating molecules that bind to proteins that are abundant on tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In more recent work, Hammond has begun developing nanoparticles that can target ovarian cancer and help prevent recurrence of the disease after chemotherapy. In about 70 percent of ovarian cancer patients, the first round of treatment is highly effective, but tumors recur in about 85 percent of those cases, and these new tumors are usually highly drug resistant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By altering the type of coating applied to drug-delivering nanoparticles, Hammond has found that the particles can be designed to either get inside tumor cells or stick to their surfaces. Using particles that stick to the cells, she has designed a treatment that could help to jumpstart a patient’s immune response to any recurrent tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With ovarian cancer, very few immune cells exist in that space, and because they don’t have a lot of immune cells present, it’s very difficult to rev up an immune response,” she said. “However, if we can deliver a molecule to neighboring cells, those few that are present, and get them revved up, then we might be able to do something.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that end, she designed nanoparticles that deliver IL-12, a cytokine that stimulates nearby T cells to spring into action and begin attacking tumor cells. In a study of mice, she found that this treatment induced a long-term memory T-cell response that prevented recurrence of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hammond closed her lecture by describing the impact that the Institute has had on her throughout her career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a transformative experience,” she said. “I really think of this place as special because it brings people together and enables us to do things together that we couldn’t do alone. And it is that support we get from our friends, our colleagues, and our students that really makes things possible.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Unlocking mRNA’s cancer-fighting potential</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT spinout Strand Therapeutics has developed a new class of mRNA molecules that can sense where they are in the body, for more targeted and powerful treatments.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What if training your immune system to attack cancer cells was as easy as training it to fight Covid-19? Many people believe the technology behind some Covid-19 vaccines, messenger RNA, holds great promise for stimulating immune responses to cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But using messenger RNA, or mRNA, to get the immune system to mount a prolonged and aggressive attack on cancer cells — while leaving healthy cells alone — has been a major challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT spinout Strand Therapeutics is attempting to solve that problem with an advanced class of mRNA molecules that are designed to sense what type of cells they encounter in the body and to express therapeutic proteins only once they have entered diseased cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about finding ways to deal with the signal-to-noise ratio, the signal being expression in the target tissue and the noise being expression in the non-target tissue,” Strand CEO Jacob Becraft PhD ’19 explains. “Our technology amplifies the signal to express more proteins for longer while at the same time effectively eliminating the mRNA’s off-target expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strand is set to begin its first clinical trial in April, which is testing a self-replicating mRNA molecule’s ability to express immune signals directly from a tumor, triggering the immune system to attack and kill the tumor cells directly. It’s also being tested as a possible improvement for existing treatments to a number of solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they work to commercialize its early innovations, Strand’s team is continuing to add capabilities to what it calls its “programmable medicines,” improving mRNA molecules’ ability to sense their environment and generate potent, targeted responses where they’re needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Self-replicating mRNA was the first thing that we pioneered when we were at MIT and in the first couple years at Strand,” Becraft says. “Now we’ve also moved into approaches like circular mRNAs, which allow each molecule of mRNA to express more of a protein for longer, potentially for weeks at a time. And the bigger our cell-type specific datasets become, the better we are at differentiating cell types, which makes these molecules so targeted we can have a higher level of safety at higher doses and create stronger treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making mRNA smarter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becraft got his first taste of MIT as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois when he secured a summer internship in the lab of MIT Institute Professor Bob Langer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That’s where I learned how lab research could be translated into spinout companies,” Becraft recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience left enough of an impression on Becraft that he returned to MIT the next fall to earn his PhD, where he worked in the Synthetic Biology Center under professor of bioengineering and electrical engineering and computer science Ron Weiss. During that time, he collaborated with postdoc Tasuku Kitada to create genetic “switches” that could control protein expression in cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becraft and Kitada realized their research could be the foundation of a company around 2017 and started spending time in the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship. They also received support from &lt;a href="https://sandbox.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Sandbox&lt;/a&gt; and eventually worked with the Technology Licensing Office to establish Strand’s early intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We started by asking, where is the highest unmet need that also allows us to prove out the thesis of this technology? And where will this approach have therapeutic relevance that is a quantum leap forward from what anyone else is doing?” Becraft says. “The first place we looked was oncology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have been working on cancer immunotherapy, which turns a patient’s immune system against cancer cells, for decades. Scientists in the field have developed drugs that produce some remarkable results in patients with aggressive, late-stage cancers. But most next-generation cancer immunotherapies are based on recombinant (lab-made) proteins that are difficult to deliver to specific targets in the body and don’t remain active for long enough to consistently create a durable response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, companies like Moderna, whose &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/mit-companies-covid-19-0326" target="_blank"&gt;founders also include MIT alumni&lt;/a&gt;, have pioneered the use of mRNAs to create proteins in cells. But to date, those mRNA molecules have not been able to change behavior based on the type of cells they enter, and don’t last for very long in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you’re trying to engage the immune system with a tumor cell, the mRNA needs to be expressing from the tumor cell itself, and it needs to be expressing over a long period of time,” Becraft says. “Those challenges are hard to overcome with the first generation of mRNA technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strand has developed what it calls the world’s first mRNA programming language that allows the company to specify the tissues its mRNAs express proteins in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We built a database that says, ‘Here are all of the different cells that the mRNA could be delivered to, and here are all of their microRNA signatures,’ and then we use computational tools and machine learning to differentiate the cells,” Becraft explains. “For instance, I need to make sure that the messenger RNA turns off when it's in the liver cell, and I need to make sure that it turns on when it's in a tumor cell or a T-cell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strand also uses techniques like mRNA self-replication to create more durable protein expression and immune responses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The first versions of mRNA therapeutics, like the Covid-19 vaccines, just recapitulate how our body’s natural mRNAs work,” Becraft explains. “Natural mRNAs last for a few days, maybe less, and they express a single protein. They have no context-dependent actions. That means wherever the mRNA is delivered, it’s only going to express a molecule for a short period of time. That’s perfect for a vaccine, but it’s much more limiting when you want to create a protein that’s actually engaging in a biological process, like activating an immune response against a tumor that could take many days or weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technology with broad potential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strand’s first clinical trial is targeting solid tumors like melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer. The company is also actively developing mRNA therapies that could be used to treat blood cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ll be expanding into new areas as we continue to de-risk the translation of the science and create new technologies,” Becraft says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strand plans to partner with large pharmaceutical companies as well as investors to continue developing drugs. Further down the line, the founders believe future versions of its mRNA therapies could be used to treat a broad range of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our thesis is: amplified expression in specific, programmed target cells for long periods of time,” Becraft says. “That approach can be utilized for [immunotherapies like] CAR T-cell therapy, both in oncology and autoimmune conditions. There are also many diseases that require cell-type specific delivery and expression of proteins in treatment, everything from kidney disease to types of liver disease. We can envision our technology being used for all of that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Five MIT faculty members take on Cancer Grand Challenges  </title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-faculty-take-on-cancer-grand-challenges-0318</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Joining three teams backed by a total of $75 million, MIT researchers will tackle some of cancer’s toughest challenges.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Bendta Schroeder | Koch Institute</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cancer Grand Challenges recently announced five winning teams for 2024, which included five researchers from MIT: Michael Birnbaum, Regina Barzilay, Brandon DeKosky, Seychelle Vos, and Ömer Yilmaz. Each team is made up of interdisciplinary cancer researchers from across the globe and will be awarded $25 million over five years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnbaum, an associate professor in the Department of Biological Engineering, leads Team MATCHMAKERS and is joined by co-investigators Barzilay, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor for AI and Health in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the AI faculty lead at the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health; and DeKosky, Phillip and Susan Ragon Career Development Professor of Chemical Engineering. All three are also affiliates of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research At MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team MATCHMAKERS will take advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to develop tools for personalized immunotherapies for cancer patients. Cancer immunotherapies, which recruit the patient’s own immune system against the disease, have transformed treatment for some cancers, but not for all types and not for all patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T cells are one target for immunotherapies because of their central role in the immune response. These immune cells use receptors on their surface to recognize protein fragments called antigens on cancer cells. Once T cells attach to cancer antigens, they mark them for destruction by the immune system. However, T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse within one person’s immune system and from person to person, making it difficult to predict how any one cancer patient will respond to an immunotherapy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team MATCHMAKERS will collect data on T cell receptors and the different antigens they target and build computer models to predict antigen recognition by different T cell receptors. The team’s overarching goal is to develop tools for predicting T cell recognition with simple clinical lab tests and designing antigen-specific immunotherapies. “If successful, what we learn on our team could help transform prediction of T cell receptor recognition from something that is only possible in a few sophisticated laboratories in the world, for a few people at a time, into a routine process,” says Birnbaum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The MATCHMAKERS project draws on MIT’s long tradition of developing cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools for the benefit of society,” comments Ryan Schoenfeld, CEO of The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research. “Their approach to optimizing immunotherapy for cancer and many other diseases is exemplary of the type of interdisciplinary research &lt;a href="https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthemarkfoundation.org%2F&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Crachel.cresswell%40cancer.org.uk%7C54187c7cc7ed4b8dfbf208dc388b67ec%7C4473892f71e046fc8dec273902b51349%7C0%7C0%7C638447418630115904%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=no45ESAo3WUta951BUZLbQf%2FxmgyvQPZT7jr7DukRuc%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0"&gt;The Mark Foundation&lt;/a&gt; prioritizes supporting.” In addition to The Mark Foundation, the MATCHMAKERS team is funded by Cancer Research UK and the U.S. National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vos, the Robert A. Swanson (1969) Career Development Professor of Life Sciences and HHMI Freeman Hrabowksi Scholar in the Department of Biology, will be a co-investigator on Team KOODAC. The KOODAC team will develop new treatments for solid tumors in children, using protein degradation strategies to target previously “undruggable” drivers of cancers. KOODAC is funded by Cancer Research UK, France's Institut National Du Cancer, and KiKa (Children Cancer Free Foundation) through Cancer Grand Challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a co-investigator on team PROSPECT, Yilmaz, who is also a Koch Institute affiliate, will help address early-onset colorectal cancers, an emerging global problem among individuals younger than 50 years. The team seeks to elucidate pathways, risk factors, and molecules involved in the disease’s development. Team PROSPECT is supported by Cancer Research UK, the U.S. National Cancer Institute, the Bowelbabe Fund for Cancer Research UK, and France's Institut National Du Cancer through Cancer Grand Challenges.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tumors can carry mutations in hundreds of different genes, and each of those genes may be mutated in different ways — some mutations simply replace one DNA nucleotide with another, while others insert or delete larger sections of DNA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until now, there has been no way to quickly and easily screen each of those mutations in their natural setting to see what role they may play in the development, progression, and treatment response of a tumor. Using a variant of CRISPR genome-editing known as prime editing, MIT researchers have now come up with a way to screen those mutations much more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrated their technique by screening cells with more than 1,000 different mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53, all of which have been seen in cancer patients. This method, which is easier and faster than any existing approach, and edits the genome rather than introducing an artificial version of the mutant gene, revealed that some p53 mutations are more harmful than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique could also be applied to many other cancer genes, the researchers say, and could eventually be used for precision medicine, to determine how an individual patient’s tumor will respond to a particular treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In one experiment, you can generate thousands of genotypes that are seen in cancer patients, and immediately test whether one or more of those genotypes are sensitive or resistant to any type of therapy that you’re interested in using,” says Francisco Sanchez-Rivera, an MIT assistant professor of biology, a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT graduate student Samuel Gould is the lead author of the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-024-02172-9" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing cells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new technique builds on &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/fast-modeling-cancer-mutations-1022" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that Sanchez-Rivera began 10 years ago as an MIT graduate student. At that time, working with Tyler Jacks, the David H. Koch Professor of Biology, and then-postdoc Thales Papagiannakopoulos, Sanchez-Rivera developed a way to use CRISPR genome-editing to introduce into mice genetic mutations linked to lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that study, the researchers showed that they could delete genes that are often lost in lung tumor cells, and the resulting tumors were similar to naturally arising tumors with those mutations. However, this technique did not allow for the creation of point mutations (substitutions of one nucleotide for another) or insertions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While some cancer patients have deletions in certain genes, the vast majority of mutations that cancer patients have in their tumors also include point mutations or small insertions,” Sanchez-Rivera says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, David Liu, a professor in the Harvard University Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and a core institute member of the Broad Institute, has developed new CRISPR-based genome editing technologies that can generate additional types of mutations more easily. With base editing, developed in 2016, researchers can engineer point mutations, but not all possible point mutations. In 2019, Liu, who is also an author of the &lt;em&gt;Nature Biotechnology&lt;/em&gt; study, developed a technique called prime editing, which enables any kind of point mutation to be introduced, as well as insertions and deletions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Prime editing in theory solves one of the major challenges with earlier forms of CRISPR-based editing, which is that it allows you to engineer virtually any type of mutation,” Sanchez-Rivera says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they began working on this project, Sanchez-Rivera and Gould calculated that if performed successfully, prime editing could be used to generate more than 99 percent of all small mutations seen in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, to achieve that, they needed to find a way to optimize the editing efficiency of the CRISPR-based system. The prime editing guide RNAs (pegRNAs) used to direct CRISPR enzymes to cut the genome in certain spots have varying levels of efficiency, which leads to “noise” in the data from pegRNAs that simply aren’t generating the correct target mutation. The MIT team devised a way to reduce that noise by using synthetic target sites to help them calculate how efficiently each guide RNA that they tested was working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We can design multiple prime-editing guide RNAs with different design properties, and then we get an empirical measurement of how efficient each of those pegRNAs is. It tells us what percentage of the time each pegRNA is actually introducing the correct edit,” Gould says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing mutations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers demonstrated their technique using p53, a gene that is mutated in more than half of all cancer patients. From a dataset that includes sequencing information from more than 40,000 patients, the researchers identified more than 1,000 different mutations that can occur in p53.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to focus on p53 because it’s the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers, but only the most frequent variants in p53 have really been deeply studied. There are many variants in p53 that remain understudied,” Gould says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using their new method, the researchers introduced p53 mutations in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, then measured the survival rates of these cells, allowing them to determine each mutation’s effect on cell fitness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among their findings, they showed that some p53 mutations promoted cell growth more than had been previously thought. These mutations, which prevent the p53 protein from forming a tetramer — an assembly of four p53 proteins — had been studied before, using a technique that involves inserting artificial copies of a mutated p53 gene into a cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those studies found that these mutations did not confer any survival advantage to cancer cells. However, when the MIT team introduced those same mutations using the new prime editing technique, they found that the mutation prevented the tetramer from forming, allowing the cells to survive. Based on the studies done using overexpression of artificial p53 DNA, those mutations would have been classified as benign, while the new work shows that under more natural circumstances, they are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This is a case where you could only observe these variant-induced phenotypes if you're engineering the variants in their natural context and not with these more artificial systems,” Gould says. “This is just one example, but it speaks to a broader principle that we’re going to be able to access novel biology using these new genome-editing technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is difficult to reactivate tumor suppressor genes, there are few drugs that target p53, but the researchers now plan to investigate mutations found in other cancer-linked genes, in hopes of discovering potential cancer therapies that could target those mutations. They also hope that the technique could one day enable personalized approaches to treating tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With the advent of sequencing technologies in the clinic, we'll be able to use this genetic information to tailor therapies for patients suffering from tumors that have a defined genetic makeup,” Sanchez-Rivera says. “This approach based on prime editing has the potential to change everything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, an MIT School of Science Fellowship in Cancer Research, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Hanna Gray Fellowship, the V Foundation for Cancer Research, a National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant, the Ludwig Center at MIT, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Casey and Family Foundation Cancer Research Fund, Upstage Lung Cancer, and the Michael (1957) and Inara Erdei Cancer Research Fund, and the MIT Research Support Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT chemists have designed a sensor that detects tiny quantities of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — chemicals found in food packaging, nonstick cookware, and many other consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These compounds, also known as “forever chemicals” because they do not break down naturally, have been linked to a variety of harmful health effects, including cancer, reproductive problems, and disruption of the immune and endocrine systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the new sensor technology, the researchers showed that they could detect PFAS levels as low as 200 parts per trillion in a water sample. The device they designed could offer a way for consumers to test their drinking water, and it could also be useful in industries that rely heavily on PFAS chemicals, including the manufacture of semiconductors and firefighting equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There’s a real need for these sensing technologies. We’re stuck with these chemicals for a long time, so we need to be able to detect them and get rid of them,” says Timothy Swager, the John D. MacArthur Professor of Chemistry at MIT and the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/153648" target="_blank"&gt;appears this week&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other authors of the paper are former MIT postdoc and lead author Sohyun Park and MIT graduate student Collette Gordon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting PFAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coatings containing PFAS chemicals are used in thousands of consumer products. In addition to nonstick coatings for cookware, they are also commonly used in water-repellent clothing, stain-resistant fabrics, grease-resistant pizza boxes, cosmetics, and firefighting foams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These fluorinated chemicals, which have been in widespread use since the 1950s, can be released into water, air, and soil, from factories, sewage treatment plants, and landfills. They have been found in drinking water sources in all 50 states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/questions-and-answers-drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-pfos-genx-chemicals-and-pfbs#:~:text=In%20March%202023%2C%20EPA%20proposed,as%20a%20mixture%20of%20contaminants"&gt;determined&lt;/a&gt; “health advisory levels” for two of the most hazardous PFAS chemicals, known as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctyl sulfonate (PFOS), in drinking water, setting them at 0.004 parts per trillion and 0.02 parts per trillion, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only way that a consumer could determine if their drinking water contains PFAS is to send a water sample to a laboratory that performs mass spectrometry testing. However, this process takes several weeks and costs hundreds of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a cheaper and faster way to test for PFAS, the MIT team designed a sensor based on lateral flow technology — the same approach used for rapid Covid-19 tests and pregnancy tests. Instead of a test strip coated with antibodies, the new sensor is embedded with a special polymer known as polyaniline, which can switch between semiconducting and conducting states when protons are added to the material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers deposited these polymers onto a strip of nitrocellulose paper and coated them with a surfactant that can pull fluorocarbons such as PFAS out of a drop of water placed on the strip. When this happens, protons from the PFAS are drawn into the polyaniline and turn it into a conductor, reducing the electrical resistance of the material. This change in resistance, which can be measured precisely using electrodes and sent to an external device such as a smartphone, gives a quantitative measurement of how much PFAS is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach works only with PFAS that are acidic, which includes two of the most harmful PFAS — PFOA and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A user-friendly system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current version of the sensor can detect concentrations as low as 200 parts per trillion for PFBA, and 400 parts per trillion for PFOA. This is not quite low enough to meet the current EPA guidelines, but the sensor uses only a fraction of a milliliter of water. The researchers are now working on a larger-scale device that would be able to filter about a liter of water through a membrane made of polyaniline, and they believe this approach should increase the sensitivity by more than a hundredfold, with the goal of meeting the very low EPA advisory levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We do envision a user-friendly, household system,” Swager says. “You can imagine putting in a liter of water, letting it go through the membrane, and you have a device that measures the change in resistance of the membrane.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a device could offer a less expensive, rapid alternative to current PFAS detection methods. If PFAS are detected in drinking water, there are commercially available filters that can be used on household drinking water to reduce those levels. The new testing approach could also be useful for factories that manufacture products with PFAS chemicals, so they could test whether the water used in their manufacturing process is safe to release into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by an MIT School of Science Fellowship to Gordon, a Bose Research Grant, and a Fulbright Fellowship to Park.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A noninvasive treatment for “chemo brain”</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/noninvasive-treatment-chemo-brain-0306</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Stimulating gamma brain waves may protect cancer patients from memory impairment and other cognitive effects of chemotherapy.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2024 14:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients undergoing chemotherapy often experience cognitive effects such as memory impairment and difficulty concentrating — a condition commonly known as “chemo brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have now shown that a noninvasive treatment that stimulates gamma frequency brain waves may hold promise for treating chemo brain. In a study of mice, they found that daily exposure to light and sound with a frequency of 40 hertz protected brain cells from chemotherapy-induced damage. The treatment also helped to prevent memory loss and impairment of other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This treatment, which was originally developed as a way to treat Alzheimer’s disease, appears to have widespread effects that could help with a variety of neurological disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The treatment can reduce DNA damage, reduce inflammation, and increase the number of oligodendrocytes, which are the cells that produce myelin surrounding the axons,” says Li-Huei Tsai, director of MIT’s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Picower Professor in the MIT Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences. “We also found that this treatment improved learning and memory, and enhanced executive function in the animals.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsai is the senior author of the new study, which &lt;a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/153638" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead author is TaeHyun Kim, an MIT postdoc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protective brain waves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, Tsai and her colleagues began exploring the use of light flickering at 40 hertz (cycles per second) as a way to improve the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. Previous work had suggested that Alzheimer’s patients have impaired gamma oscillations — brain waves that range from 25 to 80 hertz (cycles per second) and are believed to contribute to brain functions such as attention, perception, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tsai’s &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/visual-stimulation-treatment-alzheimer-1207" target="_blank"&gt;studies in mice&lt;/a&gt; have found that exposure to light flickering at 40 hertz or sounds with a pitch of 40 hertz can stimulate gamma waves in the brain, which has many protective effects, including preventing the formation of amyloid beta plaques. Using light and sound together provides even more significant protection. The treatment also appears promising in humans: Phase 1 &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/small-studies-40hz-sensory-stimulation-confirm-safety-suggest-alzheimers-benefits-1213" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; in people with early-stage Alzheimer’s disease have found the treatment is safe and does offer some neurological and behavioral benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers set out to see whether this treatment could also counteract the cognitive effects of chemotherapy treatment. Research has shown that these drugs can induce inflammation in the brain, as well as other detrimental effects such as loss of white matter — the networks of nerve fibers that help different parts of the brain communicate with each other. Chemotherapy drugs also promote loss of myelin, the protective fatty coating that allows neurons to propagate electrical signals. Many of these effects are also seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Chemo brain caught our attention because it is extremely common, and there is quite a lot of research on what the brain is like following chemotherapy treatment,” Tsai says. “From our previous work, we know that this gamma sensory stimulation has anti-inflammatory effects, so we decided to use the chemo brain model to test whether sensory gamma stimulation can be beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an experimental model, the researchers used mice that were given cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug often used to treat testicular, ovarian, and other cancers. The mice were given cisplatin for five days, then taken off of it for five days, then on again for five days. One group received chemotherapy only, while another group was also given 40-hertz light and sound therapy every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After three weeks, mice that received cisplatin but not gamma therapy showed many of the expected effects of chemotherapy: brain volume shrinkage, DNA damage, demyelination, and inflammation. These mice also had reduced populations of oligodendrocytes, the brain cells responsible for producing myelin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, mice that received gamma therapy along with cisplatin treatment showed significant reductions in all of those symptoms. The gamma therapy also had beneficial effects on behavior: Mice that received the therapy performed much better on tests designed to measure memory and executive function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A fundamental mechanism”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the researchers analyzed the gene expression changes that occurred in mice that received the gamma treatment. They found that in those mice, inflammation-linked genes and genes that trigger cell death were suppressed, especially in oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for producing myelin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mice that received gamma treatment along with cisplatin, some of the beneficial effects could still be seen up to four months later. However, the gamma treatment was much less effective if it was started three months after the chemotherapy ended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also showed that the gamma treatment improved the signs of chemo brain in mice that received a different chemotherapy drug, methotrexate, which is used to treat breast, lung, and other types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think this is a very fundamental mechanism to improve myelination and to promote the integrity of oligodendrocytes. It seems that it’s not specific to the agent that induces demyelination, be it chemotherapy or another source of demyelination,” Tsai says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of its widespread effects, Tsai’s lab is also testing gamma treatment in mouse models of other neurological diseases, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. Cognito Therapeutics, a company founded by Tsai and MIT Professor Edward Boyden, has finished a phase 2 trial of gamma therapy in Alzheimer’s patients, and plans to begin a phase 3 trial this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My lab’s major focus now, in terms of clinical application, is Alzheimer’s; but hopefully we can test this approach for a few other indications, too,” Tsai says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the JPB Foundation, the Ko Hahn Seed Fund, and the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the immune system’s primary roles is to detect and kill cells that have acquired cancerous mutations. However, some early-stage cancer cells manage to evade this surveillance and develop into more advanced tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new study from MIT and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has identified one strategy that helps these precancerous cells avoid immune detection. The researchers found that early in colon cancer development, cells that turn on a gene called SOX17 can become essentially invisible to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If scientists could find a way to block SOX17 function or the pathway that it activates, this may offer a new way to treat early-stage cancers before they grow into larger tumors, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Activation of the SOX17 program in the earliest innings of colorectal cancer formation is a critical step that shields precancerous cells from the immune system. If we can inhibit the SOX17 program, we might be better able to prevent colon cancer, particularly in patients that are prone to developing colon polyps,” says Omer Yilmaz, an MIT associate professor of biology, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and one of the senior authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judith Agudo, a principal investigator at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, is also a senior author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07135-3" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead author is MIT Research Scientist Norihiro Goto. Other collaborators include Tyler Jacks, a professor of biology and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute; Peter Westcott, a former Jacks lab postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; and Saori Goto, an MIT postdoc in the Yilmaz lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immune evasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colon cancer usually arises in long-lived cells called intestinal stem cells, whose job is to continually regenerate the lining of the intestines. Over their long lifetime, these cells can accumulate cancerous mutations that lead to the formation of polyps, a type of premalignant growth that can eventually become metastatic colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how these precancerous growths evade the immune system, the researchers used a technique they had previously developed for growing mini colon tumors in a lab dish and then implanting them into mice. In this case, the researchers engineered the tumors to express mutated versions of cancer-linked genes Kras, p53, and APC, which are often found in human colon cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once these tumors were implanted in mice, the researchers observed a dramatic increase in the tumors’ expression of SOX17. This gene encodes a transcription factor that is normally active only during embryonic development, when it helps to control development of the intestines and the formation of blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ experiments revealed that when SOX17 is turned on in cancer cells, it helps the cells to create an immunosuppressive environment. Among its effects, SOX17 prevents cells from synthesizing the receptor that normally detects interferon gamma, a molecule that is one of the immune system’s primary weapons against cancer cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without those interferon gamma receptors, cancerous and precancerous cells can simply ignore messages from the immune system, which would normally direct them to undergo programmed cell death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of SOX17’s main roles is to turn off the interferon gamma signaling pathway in colorectal cancer cells and in precancerous adenoma cells. By turning off interferon gamma receptor signaling in the tumor cells, the tumor cells become hidden from T cells and can grow in the presence of an immune system,” Yilmaz says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without interferon gamma signaling, cancer cells also minimize their production of molecules called MHC proteins, which are responsible for displaying cancerous antigens to the immune system. The cells’ insensitivity to interferon gamma also prevents them from producing immune molecules called chemokines, which normally recruit T cells that would help destroy the cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting SOX17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the researchers generated colon tumor organoids with SOX17 knocked out, and implanted those into mice, the immune system was able to attack those tumors much more effectively. This suggests that preventing cancer cells from turning off SOX17 could offer a way to treat colon cancer in its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just by turning off SOX17 in fairly complex tumors, we were able to essentially obliterate the ability of these tumor cells to persist,” Goto says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers also analyzed gene expression data from patients with colon cancer and found that SOX17 tended to be highly expressed in early-stage colon cancers but dropped off as the tumors became more invasive and metastatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think this makes a lot of sense because as colorectal cancers become more invasive and metastatic, there are other mechanisms that create an immunosuppressive environment,” Yilmaz says. “As the colon cancer becomes more aggressive and activates these other mechanisms, then there’s less importance for SOX17.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcription factors such as SOX17 are considered difficult to target using drugs, in part because of their disorganized structure, so the researchers now plan to identify other proteins that SOX17 interacts with, in hopes that it might be easier to block some of those interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also plan to investigate what triggers SOX17 to turn on in precancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the MIT Stem Cell Initiative via Fondation MIT, the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute, and a Koch Institute-Dana Farber Harvard Cancer Center Bridge Project grant.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic cancer vaccines are an appealing strategy for treating malignancies. In theory, when a patient is injected with peptide antigens — protein fragments from mutant proteins only expressed by tumor cells — T cells learn to recognize and attack cancer cells expressing the corresponding protein. By teaching the patient’s own immune system to attack cancer cells, these vaccines ideally would not only eliminate tumors but prevent them from recurring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, however, effective cancer vaccines have not materialized, despite decades of research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There has been a lot of work to make cancer vaccines more effective,” says Darrell Irvine, a professor in the MIT departments of Biological Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. “But even in mouse and other models, they typically only provoke a weak immune response. And once those vaccines are tested in a clinical setting, their efficacy evaporates.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New hope may now be on the horizon. A vaccine based on a novel approach developed by Irvine and colleagues at MIT, and refined by researchers at &lt;a href="https://elicio.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Elicio Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, an MIT spinout that Irvine founded to translate experiments into treatment, is showing promising results in clinical trials — including Phase 1 data suggesting the vaccine could serve as a viable option for the treatment of pancreatic and other cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating a question&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Haipeng Liu joined Irvine’s laboratory as a postdoc almost 15 years ago, he wanted to dive into the problem of why cancer vaccines have failed to deliver on their promise. He discovered that one important reason peptide vaccines for cancer and other diseases tend not to elicit a strong immune response is because they do not travel in sufficient quantities to lymph nodes, where populations of teachable T cells are concentrated. He knew that attempts to target peptides to the lymph nodes had been imprecise: Even when delivered with nanoparticles or attached to antibodies for lymphatic immune cells, too many vaccine peptides were taken up by the wrong cells in the tissues or never even made it to the lymph nodes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Liu, now an associate professor of chemical engineering and materials science at Wayne State University, also had a simple, unanswered question: If vaccine peptides did not make it to the lymph nodes, where did they go?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the pursuit of an answer, Liu and his Irvine Lab colleagues would make discoveries crucial to trafficking peptides to the lymph nodes and developing a vaccine that provoked surprisingly strong immune responses in mice. That vaccine, now in the hands of Irvine Lab spinout Elicio Therapeutics, Inc., has produced early clinical results showing a similarly strong immune response in human patients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liu began with testing peptide vaccines in mouse models, finding that peptides injected in the skin or muscle generally rapidly leak into the bloodstream, where they are diluted and degraded rather than traveling to the lymph nodes.&amp;nbsp;He tried bulking up and protecting the peptide vaccine by enclosing it within a micellar nanoparticle. This type of nanoparticle is composed of “amphiphilic” molecules, with hydrophilic heads that, in a water-based solution, encase a payload attached to its hydrophobic lipid tails. Liu tested two versions, one that locked the micellar molecules together to securely enclose the peptide vaccine and another, the control, that did not. Despite all the sophisticated chemistry that went into the locked micellar nanoparticles, they induced a weak immune response. Liu was crushed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Irvine, however, was elated. The loosely bound control micelles produced the strongest immune response he had ever seen. Liu had hit on a potential solution — just not the one he expected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formulating a vaccine&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Liu was working on micellar nanoparticles, he had also been delving into the biology of the lymph node. He learned that after removing a tumor, surgeons use a small blue dye to image lymph nodes to determine the extent of metastasis. Contrary to expectation raised by the dye molecule’s small molecular weight, it does not vanish into the bloodstream after administration. Instead, the dye binds to albumin, the most common protein in blood and tissue fluids, and tracks reliably to the lymph nodes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amphiphiles in Liu’s control group behaved similarly to the imaging dye. Once injected into the tissue, the “loose” micelles were broken up by albumin, which then carried the peptide payload just where it needed to go. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking the imaging dye as a model, the lab began to develop a vaccine that used lipid tails to bind their peptide chains to lymph node-targeting albumin molecules.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once their albumin-hitchhiking vaccine was assembled, they tested it in mouse models of HIV, melanoma, and cervical cancer. In the resulting &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/hitchhiking-vaccines-boost-immunity-0216"&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt;, they observed that peptides modified to bind albumin produced a T cell response that was five to 10 times greater than the response to peptides alone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In later work, Irvine lab researchers were able to generate even larger immune responses. In &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/car-t-cell-therapy-cancer-0711"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt;, the Irvine Lab paired a cancer-targeted vaccine with CAR T cell therapy. CAR T has been used to treat blood cancers such as leukemia successfully but has not worked well for solid tumors, which suppress T cells in their immediate vicinity. The vaccine and CAR T cell therapy together dramatically increased antitumor T cell populations and the number of T cells that successfully invaded the tumor. The combination resulted in the elimination of 60% of solid tumors in mice, while CAR T cell therapy alone had almost no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A model for patient impact&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2016, Irvine was ready to begin translating the vaccine from lab bench experiments to a patient-ready treatment, spinning out a new company, Elicio.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We made sure we were setting a high bar in the lab,” said Irvine. “In addition to leveraging albumin biology that is the same in mouse and humans, we aimed for and achieved 10-, 30-, 40-fold greater responses in the animal model relative to other gold standard vaccine approaches, and this gave us hope that these results would translate to greater immune responses in patients.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Elicio, Irvine’s vaccine has evolved into a platform combining lipid-linked peptides with an immune adjuvant—no CAR T cells required. In 2021, the company began a clinical trial, AMPLIFY-201, of a vaccine named ELI-002, targeting cancers with mutations in the KRAS gene, with a focus on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The vaccine has the potential to fill an urgent need in cancer treatment: PDAC accounts for 90% of pancreatic cancers, is highly aggressive, and has limited options for effective treatment. KRAS mutations drive 90-95% of all PDAC cases, but there are several variations that must be individually targeted for effective treatment. Elicio’s cancer vaccine has the potential to target up to seven KRAS variants at once covering 88% of PDAC cases. The company has initially tested a version that targets two, and Phase 1 and 2 studies of the version targeting all seven KRAS mutants are ongoing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02760-3" target="_blank"&gt;Data published last month in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the Phase 1 clinical trial suggests that an effective therapeutic cancer vaccine could be on the horizon. The robust responses seen in the Irvine Lab’s mouse models have so far translated to the 25 patients (20 pancreatic, 5 colorectal) in the trial: 84% of patients showed an average 56-fold increase in the number of antitumor T cells, with complete elimination of blood biomarkers of residual tumor in 24%. Patients who had a strong immune response saw an 86% reduction in the risk of cancer progression or death. The vaccine was tolerated well by patients, with no serious side effects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The reason I joined Elicio was, in part, because my father had KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer,” said Christopher Haqq, executive vice president, head of research and development, and chief medical officer at Elicio. “His journey made me realize the enormous need for new therapy for KRAS-mutated tumors. It gives me hope that we are on the right path to be able to help people just like my dad and many others.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of the PDAC clinical trial, Elicio is currently testing the formulation of the vaccine that targets seven KRAS mutations. The company has plans to address other KRAS-driven cancers, such as colorectal and non-small cell lung cancers. Peter DeMuth PhD '13, a former graduate student in the Irvine Lab and now chief scientific officer at Elicio, credits the Koch Institute’s research culture with shaping the evolution of the vaccine and the company. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The model adopted by the KI to bring together basic science and engineering while encouraging collaboration at the intersection of complementary disciplines was critical to shaping my view of innovation and passion for technology that can deliver real-world impact,” he recalls. “This proved to be a very special ecosystem for me and many others to cultivate an engineering mindset while building a comprehensive interdisciplinary knowledge of immunology, applied chemistry, and materials science. These themes have become central to our work at Elicio.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding for research on which Elicio’s vaccine platform is based was provided, in part, by a Koch Institute Quinquennial Cancer Research Fellowship, the Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicine, and the Bridge Project, a partnership between the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated on Feb. 16 to clarify the goal of a vaccine currently in clinical trials.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A tiny device built by scientists at MIT and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology could be used to improve the safety and effectiveness of cell therapy treatments for patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cell therapy, clinicians create what are known as induced pluripotent stem cells by reprogramming some skin or blood cells taken from a patient. To treat a spinal cord injury, they would coax these pluripotent stem cells to become progenitor cells, which are destined to differentiate into spinal cord cells. These progenitors are then transplanted back into the patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These new cells can regenerate part of the injured spinal cord. However, pluripotent stem cells that don’t fully change into progenitors can form tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research team developed a microfluidic cell sorter that can remove about half of the undifferentiated cells — those that can potentially become tumors — in a batch, without causing any damage to the fully-formed progenitor cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput device, which doesn’t require special chemicals, can sort more than 3 million cells per minute. In addition, the researchers have shown that chaining many devices together can sort more than 500 million cells per minute, making this a more viable method to someday improve the safety of cell therapy treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, the plastic chip that contains the microfluidic cell sorter can be mass-produced in a factory at very low cost, so the device would be easier to implement at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have a life-saving cell therapy that is doing wonders for patients, if you cannot manufacture it cost-effectively, reliably, and safely, then its impact might be limited. Our team is passionate about that problem — we want to make these therapies more reliable and easily accessible,” says Jongyoon Han, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of biological engineering, a member of the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE), and co-lead principal investigator of the CAMP (Critical Analytics for Manufacturing Personalized Medicine) research group at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Han is joined on the paper by co-senior author Sing Yian Chew, professor of chemistry, chemical engineering, and biotechnology at the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and Materials Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and a CAMP principal investigator; co-lead authors Tan Dai Nguyen, a CAMP researcher; Wai Hon Chooi, a senior research fellow at the Singapore Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR); and Hyungkook Jeon, an MIT postdoc; as well as others at NTU and A*STAR. The research &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/stcltm/advance-article/doi/10.1093/stcltm/szae002/7597591" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Stem Cells Translational Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cancer risk posed by undifferentiated induced pluripotent stem cells remains one of the most pressing challenges in this type of cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have a very small population of cells that are not fully differentiated, they could still turn into cancer-like cells,” Han adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinicians and researchers often seek to identify and remove these cells by looking for certain markers on their surfaces, but so far researchers have not been able to find a marker that is specific to these undifferentiated cells. Other methods use chemicals to selectively destroy these cells, yet the chemical treatment techniques may be harmful to the differentiated cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The high-throughput microfluidic sorter, which can sort cells based on size, had been previously developed by the CAMP team after more than a decade of work. It has been previously used for sorting immune cells and mesenchymal stromal cells (another type of stem cell), and now the team is expanding its use to other stem cell types, such as induced pluripotent stem cells, Han says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are interested in regenerative strategies to enhance tissue repair after spinal cord injuries, as these conditions lead to devasting functional impairment. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective regenerative treatment approach for spinal cord injuries,” Chew says. “Spinal cord progenitor cells derived from pluripotent stem cells hold great promise, since they can generate all cell types found within the spinal cord to restore tissue structure and function. To be able to effectively utilize these cells, the first step would be to ensure their safety, which is the aim of our work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team discovered that pluripotent stem cells tend to be larger than the progenitors derived from them. It is hypothesized that before a pluripotent stem cell differentiates, its nucleus contains a large number of genes that haven’t been turned off, or suppressed. As it differentiates for a specific function, the cell suppresses many genes it will no longer need, significantly shrinking the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microfluidic device leverages this size difference to sort the cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiral sorting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microfluidic channels in the quarter-sized plastic chip form an inlet, a spiral, and four outlets that output cells of different sizes. As the cells are forced through the spiral at very high speeds, various forces, including centrifugal forces, act on the cells. These forces counteract to focus the cells in a certain location in the fluid stream. This focusing point will be dependent on the size of the cells, effectively sorting them through separate outlets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers found they could improve the sorter’s operation by running it twice, first at a lower speed so larger cells stick to the walls and smaller cells are sorted out, then at a higher speed to sort out larger cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the device operates like a centrifuge, but the microfluidic sorter does not require human intervention to pick out sorted cells, Han adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that their device could remove about 50 percent of the larger cells with one pass. They conducted experiments to confirm that the larger cells they removed were, in fact, associated with higher tumor risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While we can’t remove 100 percent of these cells, we still believe this is going to reduce the risk significantly. Hopefully, the original cell type is good enough that we don’t have too many undifferentiated cells. Then this process could make these cells even safer,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the low-cost microfluidic sorter, which can be produced at scale with standard manufacturing techniques, does not use any type of filtration. Filters can become clogged or break down, so a filter-free device can be used for a much longer time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that they have shown success at a small scale, the researchers are embarking on larger studies and animal models to see if the purified cells function better in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nondifferentiated cells can become tumors, but they can have other random effects in the body, so removing more of these cells could boost the efficacy of cell therapies, as well as improve safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If we can convincingly demonstrate these benefits in vivo, the future might hold even more exciting applications for this technique,” Han says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the National Research Foundation of Singapore and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a novel microscopy technique, MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School researchers have imaged human brain tissue in greater detail than ever before, revealing cells and structures that were not previously visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among their findings, the researchers discovered that some “low-grade” brain tumors contain more putative aggressive tumor cells than expected, suggesting that some of these tumors may be more aggressive than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that this technique could eventually be deployed to diagnose tumors, generate more accurate prognoses, and help doctors choose treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re starting to see how important the interactions of neurons and synapses with the surrounding brain are to the growth and progression of tumors. A lot of those things we really couldn’t see with conventional tools, but now we have a tool to look at those tissues at the nanoscale and try to understand these interactions,” says Pablo Valdes, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Texas Medical Branch and the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in Neurotechnology at MIT; a professor of biological engineering, media arts and sciences, and brain and cognitive sciences; a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research and Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research; and E. Antonio Chiocca, a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School and chair of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, are the senior authors of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abo0049" target="_blank"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making molecules visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new imaging method is based on &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/enlarged-brain-samples-easier-to-image-0115" target="_blank"&gt;expansion microscopy&lt;/a&gt;, a technique developed in Boyden’s lab in 2015 based on a simple premise: Instead of using powerful, expensive microscopes to obtain high-resolution images, the researchers devised a way to expand the tissue itself, allowing it to be imaged at very high resolution with a regular light microscope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique works by embedding the tissue into a polymer that swells when water is added, and then softening up and breaking apart the proteins that normally hold tissue together. Then, adding water swells the polymer, pulling all the proteins apart from each other. This tissue enlargement allows researchers to obtain images with a resolution of around 70 nanometers, which was previously possible only with very specialized and expensive microscopes such as scanning electron microscopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Boyden lab developed &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2017/microscopy-technique-could-enable-more-informative-biopsies-0717" target="_blank"&gt;a way to expand&lt;/a&gt; preserved human tissue specimens, but the chemical reagents that they used also destroyed the proteins that the researchers were interested in labeling. By labeling the proteins with fluorescent antibodies before expansion, the proteins’ location and identity could be visualized after the expansion process was complete. However, the antibodies typically used for this kind of labeling can’t easily squeeze through densely packed tissue before it’s expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for this study, the authors devised a different tissue-softening protocol that breaks up the tissue but preserves proteins in the sample. After the tissue is expanded, proteins can be labelled with commercially available fluorescent antibodies. The researchers then can perform several rounds of imaging, with three or four different proteins labeled in each round. This labelling of proteins enables many more structures to be imaged, because once the tissue is expanded, antibodies can squeeze through and label proteins they couldn’t previously reach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We open up the space between the proteins so that we can get antibodies into crowded spaces that we couldn’t otherwise,” Valdes says. “We saw that we could expand the tissue, we could decrowd the proteins, and we could image many, many proteins in the same tissue by doing multiple rounds of staining.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with MIT Assistant Professor Deblina Sarkar, the researchers demonstrated a form of this “decrowding” in 2022 using mouse tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new study resulted in a decrowding technique for use with human brain tissue samples that are used in clinical settings for pathological diagnosis and to guide treatment decisions. These samples can be more difficult to work with because they are usually embedded in paraffin and treated with other chemicals that need to be broken down before the tissue can be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers labeled up to 16 different molecules per tissue sample. The molecules they targeted include markers for a variety of structures, including axons and synapses, as well as markers that identify cell types such as astrocytes and cells that form blood vessels. They also labeled molecules linked to tumor aggressiveness and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this approach, the researchers analyzed healthy brain tissue, along with samples from patients with two types of glioma — high-grade glioblastoma, which is the most aggressive primary brain tumor, with a poor prognosis, and low-grade gliomas, which are considered less aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to look at brain tumors so that we can understand them better at the nanoscale level, and by doing that, to be able to develop better treatments and diagnoses in the future. At this point, it was more developing a tool to be able to understand them better, because currently in neuro-oncology, people haven't done much in terms of super-resolution imaging,” Valdes says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A diagnostic tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To identify aggressive tumor cells in gliomas they studied, the researchers labeled vimentin, a protein that is found in highly aggressive glioblastomas. To their surprise, they found many more vimentin-expressing tumor cells in low-grade gliomas than had been seen using any other method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This tells us something about the biology of these tumors, specifically, how some of them probably have a more aggressive nature than you would suspect by doing standard staining techniques,” Valdes says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When glioma patients undergo surgery, tumor samples are preserved and analyzed using immunohistochemistry staining, which can reveal certain markers of aggressiveness, including some of the markers analyzed in this study. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These are incurable brain cancers, and this type of discovery will allow us to figure out which cancer molecules to target so we can design better treatments. It also proves the profound impact of having clinicians like us at the Brigham and Women’s interacting with basic scientists such as Ed Boyden at MIT to discover new technologies that can improve patient lives,” Chiocca says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope their expansion microscopy technique could allow doctors to learn much more about patients’ tumors, helping them to determine how aggressive the tumor is and guiding treatment choices. Valdes now plans to do a larger study of tumor types to try to establish diagnostic guidelines based on the tumor traits that can be revealed using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is that this is going to be a diagnostic tool to pick up marker cells, interactions, and so on, that we couldn’t before,” he says. “It’s a practical tool that will help the clinical world of neuro-oncology and neuropathology look at neurological diseases at the nanoscale like never before, because fundamentally it’s a very simple tool to use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boyden’s lab also plans to use this technique to study other aspects of brain function, in healthy and diseased tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Being able to do nanoimaging is important because biology is about nanoscale things — genes, gene products, biomolecules — and they interact over nanoscale distances,” Boyden says. “We can study all sorts of nanoscale interactions, including synaptic changes, immune interactions, and changes that occur during cancer and aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by K. Lisa Yang, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, John Doerr, Open Philanthropy, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Kathy and Curt Marble Cancer Research Fund, the National Institutes of Health, and the Neurosurgery Research and Education Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The National Academy of Sciences has awarded MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins, the Amgen Professor of Biology Emerita, with the 2024 Public Welfare Medal in recognition of “her courageous leadership over three decades to create and ensure equal opportunity for women in science.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The award recognizes Hopkins’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;role in catalyzing and leading MIT’s “A Study on the Status of Women Faculty in Science,” made public in 1999. The landmark report, the result of the efforts of numerous members of the MIT faculty and administration, revealed inequities in the treatment and resources available to women versus men on the faculty at the Institute, helped drive significant changes to MIT policies and practices, and sparked a national conversation about the unequal treatment of women in science, engineering, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the medal was established in 1914 to honor extraordinary use of science for the public good, it has been awarded to several MIT-affiliated scientists, including Karl Compton, James R. Killian Jr., and Jerome B. Wiesner, as well as Vannevar Bush, Isidor I. Rabi, and Victor Weiskopf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Public Welfare Medal has been awarded to MIT faculty who have helped define our Institute and scientists who have shaped modern science on the national stage,” says Susan Hockfield, MIT president emerita. “It is more than fitting for Nancy to join their ranks, and — importantly — celebrates her critical role in increasing the participation of women in science and engineering as a significant national achievement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Hopkins joined the faculty of the MIT Center for Cancer Research (CCR) in 1973, she did not set out to become an advocate for equality for women in science. For the first 15 years, she distinguished herself in pioneering studies linking genes of RNA tumor viruses to their roles in causing some forms of cancer. But in 1989, Hopkins changed course: She began developing molecular technologies for the study of zebrafish that would help establish it as an important model for vertebrate development and cancer biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the pivot, Hopkins needed more space to accommodate fish tanks and new equipment. Although Hopkins strongly suspected that she had been assigned less lab space than her male peers in the building, her hypothesis carried little weight and her request was denied. Ever the scientist, Hopkins believed the path to more lab space was to collect data. One night in 1993, with a &lt;a href="https://mitmuseum.mit.edu/collections/object/2012.026.001"&gt;measuring tape&lt;/a&gt; in hand, she visited each lab to quantify the distribution of space in her building. Her hypothesis appeared correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopkins shared her initial findings — and her growing sense that there was bias against women scientists — with one female colleague, and then others, many of whom reported similar experiences. The senior women faculty in MIT’s School of Science began meeting to discuss their concerns, ultimately documenting them in a letter to Dean of Science Robert Birgeneau. The letter was signed by professors Susan Carey, Sylvia Ceyer, Sallie “Penny” Chisholm, Suzanne Corkin, Mildred Dresselhaus, Ann Graybiel, Ruth Lehmann, Marcia McNutt, Terry Orr-Weaver, Mary-Lou Pardue, Molly Potter, Paula Malanotte-Rizzoli, Leigh Royden, Lisa Steiner, and Joanne Stubbe. Also important were Hopkins’s discussions with Lorna Gibson, a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, since Gibson had made similar observations with her female colleagues in the School of Engineering. Despite the biases against these women, they were highly accomplished scientists. Four of them were eventually awarded the U.S. National Medal of Science, and 11 were, or became, members of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the women in the School of Science, Birgeneau established the Committee on the Status of Women Faculty in 1995, which included both female faculty and three male faculty who had been department chairs: Jerome Friedman, Dan Kleitman, and Robert Silbey. In addition to interviewing essentially all the female faculty members in the school, they collected data on salaries, space, and other resources. The committee found that of 209 tenured&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;professors in the School of Science only 15 were women, and they often had smaller wages and labs, and were raising more of their salaries from grants than equivalent male faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the urging of Lotte Bailyn, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and chair of the faculty, Hopkins and the committee summarized their findings to be presented to MIT’s faculty. Struck by the pervasive and well-documented pattern of bias against women across the School of Science, both Birgeneau and MIT President Charles Vest added prefaces to the report before it was published in the faculty newsletter. Vest commented, “I have always believed that contemporary gender discrimination within universities is part reality and part perception. True, but I now understand that reality is by far the greater part of the balance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vest took an “engineers’ approach” to addressing the report’s findings, remarking “anything I can measure, I can fix.” He tasked Provost Robert Brown with establishing committees to produce reports on the status of women faculty for all five of MIT’s schools. The reports were published in 2002 and drew attention to the small number of women faculty in some schools, as well as discrepancies similar to those first documented in the School of Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response, MIT implemented changes in hiring practices, updated pay equity reviews, and worked to improve the working environment for women faculty. On-campus day care facilities were built and leave policies were expanded for the benefit of all faculty members with families. To address underrepresentation of individuals of color, as well as the unique biases against women of color, Brown established the Council on Faculty Diversity with Hopkins and Philip Clay, then MIT’s chancellor and a professor in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Meanwhile, Vest spearheaded a collaboration with presidents of other leading universities to increase representation of women faculty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT increased the numbers of women faculty by altering hiring procedures&amp;nbsp; — particularly in the School of Engineering under Dean Thomas Magnanti and in the School of Science under Birgeneau, and later Associate Dean Hazel Sive. MIT did not need to alter its standards for hiring to increase the number of women on its faculty: Women hired with revised policies at the Institute have been equally successful and have gone on to important leadership roles at MIT and other institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the 1999 report the press thrust MIT — and Hopkins — into the national spotlight. The careful documentation in the report and first Birgeneau’s and then Vest’s endorsement of and proactive response to its findings were persuasive to many reporters and their readers. The reports and media coverage resonated with women across academia, resulting in a flood of mail to Hopkins’s inbox, as well as many requests for speaking engagements. Hopkins would eventually undertake hundreds of talks across the United States and many other countries about advocating for the equitable treatment of women in science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her advocacy work continued after her retirement. In 2019, Hopkins, along with Hockfield and Sangeeta Bhatia, the John J. and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, founded the Boston Biotech Working Group — which later evolved into the &lt;a href="https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/faculty-founder-initiative/"&gt;Faculty Founder Initiative&lt;/a&gt; — to increase women’s representation as founders and board members of biotech companies in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopkins, however, believes she became “this very visible person by chance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An almost uncountable number of people made this happen,” she continues. “Moreover, I know how much work went on before I even set foot on campus, such as by Emily Wick, Shirley Ann Jackson, Sheila Widnall, and Mildred Dresselhaus. I stood on the shoulders of a great institution and the long, hard work of many people that belong to it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The National Academy of Sciences will present the 2024 Public Welfare Medal to Hopkins in April at its 161st annual meeting. Hopkins is the recipient of many other awards and honors, both for her scientific achievements and her advocacy for women in science. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the AACR Academy. Other awards include the Centennial Medal from Harvard University, the MIT Gordon Y. Billard Award for “special service” to MIT, the MIT Laya Wiesner Community Award, the Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award, and the STAT Biomedical Innovation Award. In addition, she has received eight honorary doctorates, most recently from Rockefeller University, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the Weizmann Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A new drug candidate can shrink kidney cysts</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-drug-candidate-can-shrink-kidney-cysts-0122</link>
  <description><![CDATA[A compound originally developed to treat cancer could be repurposed to treat polycystic kidney disease, an inherited condition that can lead to kidney failure.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common form of polycystic kidney disease, can lead to kidney enlargement and eventual loss of function. The disease affects more than 12 million people worldwide, and many patients end up needing dialysis or a kidney transplant by the time they reach their 60s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and Yale University School of Medicine have now found that a compound originally developed as a potential cancer treatment holds promise for treating ADPKD. The drug works by exploiting kidney cyst cells’ vulnerability to oxidative stress — a state of imbalance between damaging free radicals and beneficial antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study employing two mouse models of the disease, the researchers found that the drug dramatically shrank kidney cysts without harming healthy kidney cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We really believe this has potential to impact the field and provide a different treatment paradigm for this important disease,” says Bogdan Fedeles, a research scientist and program manager in MIT’s Center for Environmental Health Sciences and the lead author of the study, which appears this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Essigmann, the William R. and Betsy P. Leitch Professor of Biological Engineering and Chemistry at MIT; Sorin Fedeles, executive director of the Polycystic Kidney Disease Outcomes Consortium and assistant professor (adjunct) at Yale University School of Medicine; and Stefan Somlo, the C.N.H. Long Professor of Medicine and Genetics and chief of nephrology at Yale University School of Medicine, are the senior authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2317344121" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cells under stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ADPKD typically progresses slowly. Often diagnosed when patients are in their 30s, it usually doesn’t cause serious impairment of kidney function until patients reach their 60s. The only drug that is FDA-approved to treat the disease, tolvaptan, slows growth of the cysts but has side effects that include frequent urination and possible liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essigmann’s lab did not originally set out to study PKD; the new study grew out of work on potential new drugs for cancer. Nearly 25 years ago, MIT research scientist Robert Croy, also an author of the new &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt; study, designed compounds that contain a DNA-damaging agent known as an aniline mustard, which can induce cell death in cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the mid 2000s, Fedeles, then a grad student in Essigmann’s lab, along with Essigmann and Croy, discovered that in addition to damaging DNA, these compounds also induce oxidative stress by interfering with mitochondria — the organelles that generate energy for cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumor cells are already under oxidative stress because of their abnormal metabolism. When they are treated with these compounds, known as 11beta compounds, the additional disruption helps to kill the cells. In a study published in 2011, Fedeles reported that treatment with 11beta compounds significantly suppressed the growth of prostate tumors implanted in mice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A conversation with his brother, Sorin Fedeles, who studies polycystic kidney disease, led the pair to theorize that these compounds might also be good candidates for treating kidney cysts. At the time, research in ADPKD was beginning to suggest that kidney cyst cells also experience oxidative stress, due to an abnormal metabolism that resembles that of cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were talking about a mechanism of what would be a good drug for polycystic kidney disease, and we had this intuition that the compounds that I was working with might actually have an impact in ADPKD,” Bogdan Fedeles says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 11beta compounds work by disrupting the mitochondria’s ability to generate ATP (the molecules that cells use to store energy), as well as a cofactor known as NADPH, which can act as an antioxidant to help cells neutralize damaging free radicals. Tumor cells and kidney cyst cells tend to produce increased levels of free radicals because of the oxidative stress they’re under. When these cells are treated with 11beta compounds, the extra oxidative stress, including the further depletion of NADPH, pushes the cells over the edge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A little bit of oxidative stress is OK, but the cystic cells have a low threshold for tolerating it. Whereas normal cells survive treatment, the cystic cells will die because they exceed the threshold,” Essigmann says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shrinking cysts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using two different mouse models of ADPKD, the researchers showed that 11beta-dichloro could significantly reduce the size of kidney cysts and improve kidney function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers also synthesized a “defanged” version of the compound called 11beta-dipropyl, which does not include any direct DNA-damaging ability and could potentially be safer for use in humans. They tested this compound in the early-onset model of PKD and found that it was as effective as 11beta-dichloro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of the experiments, healthy kidney cells did not appear to be affected by the treatment. That’s because healthy cells are able to withstand a small increase in oxidative stress, unlike the diseased cells, which are highly susceptible to any new disturbances, the researchers say. In addition to restoring kidney function, the treatment also ameliorated other clinical features of ADPKD; biomarkers for tissue inflammation and fibrosis were decreased in the treated mice compared to the control animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results also suggest that in patients, treatment with 11beta compounds once every few months, or even once a year, could significantly delay disease progression, and thus avoid the need for continuous, burdensome antiproliferative therapies such as tolvaptan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Based on what we know about the cyst growth paradigm, you could in theory treat patients in a pulsatile manner — once a year, or perhaps even less often — and have a meaningful impact on total kidney volume and kidney function,” Sorin Fedeles says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers now hope to run further tests on 11beta-dipropyl, as well as develop ways to produce it on a larger scale. They also plan to explore related compounds that could be good drug candidates for PKD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other MIT authors who contributed to this work include Research Scientist Nina Gubina, former postdoc Sakunchai Khumsubdee, former postdoc Denise Andrade, and former undergraduates Sally S. Liu ’20 and co-op student Jake Campolo. The research was funded by the PKD Foundation, the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences through the Center for Environmental Health Sciences at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tumors constantly shed DNA from dying cells, which briefly circulates in the patient’s bloodstream before it is quickly broken down. Many companies have created blood tests that can pick out this tumor DNA, potentially helping doctors diagnose or monitor cancer or choose a treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of tumor DNA circulating at any given time, however, is extremely small, so it has been challenging to develop tests sensitive enough to pick up that tiny signal. A team of researchers from MIT and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard has now come up with a way to significantly boost that signal, by temporarily slowing the clearance of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed two different types of injectable molecules that they call “priming agents,” which can transiently interfere with the body’s ability to remove circulating tumor DNA from the bloodstream. In a study of mice, they showed that these agents could boost DNA levels enough that the percentage of detectable early-stage lung metastases leapt from less than 10 percent to above 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach could enable not only earlier diagnosis of cancer, but also more sensitive detection of tumor mutations that could be used to guide treatment. It could also help improve detection of cancer recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can give one of these agents an hour before the blood draw, and it makes things visible that previously wouldn’t have been. The implication is that we should be able to give everybody who’s doing liquid biopsies, for any purpose, more molecules to work with,” says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhatia is one of the senior authors of the new study, along with J. Christopher Love, the Raymond A. and Helen E. St. Laurent Professor of Chemical Engineering at MIT and a member of the Koch Institute and the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard and Viktor Adalsteinsson, director of the Gerstner Center for Cancer Diagnostics at the Broad Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carmen Martin-Alonso PhD ’23, MIT and Broad Institute postdoc Shervin Tabrizi, and Broad Institute scientist Kan Xiong are the lead authors of the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adf2341" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better biopsies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquid biopsies, which enable detection of small quantities of DNA in blood samples, are now used in many cancer patients to identify mutations that could help guide treatment. With greater sensitivity, however, these tests could become useful for far more patients. Most efforts to improve the sensitivity of liquid biopsies have focused on developing new sequencing technologies to use after the blood is drawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While brainstorming ways to make liquid biopsies more informative, Bhatia, Love, Adalsteinsson, and their trainees came up with the idea of trying to increase the amount of DNA in a patient’s bloodstream before the sample is taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A tumor is always creating new cell-free DNA, and that’s the signal that we’re attempting to detect in the blood draw. Existing liquid biopsy technologies, however, are limited by the amount of material you collect in the tube of blood,” Love says. “Where this work intercedes is thinking about how to inject something beforehand that would help boost or enhance the amount of signal that is available to collect in the same small sample.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body uses two primary strategies to remove circulating DNA from the bloodstream. Enzymes called DNases circulate in the blood and break down DNA that they encounter, while immune cells known as macrophages take up cell-free DNA as blood is filtered through the liver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers decided to target each of these processes separately. To prevent DNases from breaking down DNA, they designed a monoclonal antibody that binds to circulating DNA and protects it from the enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Antibodies are well-established biopharmaceutical modalities, and they’re safe in a number of different disease contexts, including cancer and autoimmune treatments,” Love says. “The idea was, could we use this kind of antibody to help shield the DNA temporarily from degradation by the nucleases that are in circulation? And by doing so, we shift the balance to where the tumor is generating DNA slightly faster than is being degraded, increasing the concentration in a blood draw.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other priming agent they developed is a nanoparticle designed to block macrophages from taking up cell-free DNA. These cells have a well-known tendency to eat up synthetic nanoparticles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“DNA is a biological nanoparticle, and it made sense that immune cells in the liver were probably taking this up just like they do synthetic nanoparticles. And if that were the case, which it turned out to be, then we could use a safe dummy nanoparticle to distract those immune cells and leave the circulating DNA alone so that it could be at a higher concentration,” Bhatia says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earlier tumor detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their priming agents in mice that received transplants of cancer cells that tend to form tumors in the lungs. Two weeks after the cells were transplanted, the researchers showed that these priming agents could boost the amount of circulating tumor DNA recovered in a blood sample by up to 60-fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the blood sample is taken, it can be run through the same kinds of sequencing tests now used on liquid biopsy samples. These tests can pick out tumor DNA, including specific sequences used to determine the type of tumor and potentially what kinds of treatments would work best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early detection of cancer is another promising application for these priming agents. The researchers found that when mice were given the nanoparticle priming agent before blood was drawn, it allowed them to detect circulating tumor DNA in blood of 75 percent of the mice with low cancer burden, while none were detectable without this boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One of the greatest hurdles for cancer liquid biopsy testing has been the scarcity of circulating tumor DNA in a blood sample,” Adalsteinsson says. “It’s thus been encouraging to see the magnitude of the effect we’ve been able to achieve so far and to envision what impact this could have for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After either of the priming agents are injected, it takes an hour or two for the DNA levels to increase in the bloodstream, and then they return to normal within about 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ability to get peak activity of these agents within a couple of hours, followed by their rapid clearance, means that someone could go into a doctor’s office, receive an agent like this, and then give their blood for the test itself, all within one visit,” Love says. “This feature bodes well for the potential to translate this concept into clinical use.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers have launched a company called Amplifyer Bio that plans to further develop the technology, in hopes of advancing to clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A tube of blood is a much more accessible diagnostic than colonoscopy screening or even mammography,” Bhatia says. “Ultimately, if these tools really are predictive, then we should be able to get many more patients into the system who could benefit from cancer interception or better therapy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Koch Institute Support (core) Grant from the National Cancer Institute, the Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicine, the Gerstner Family Foundation, the Ludwig Center at MIT, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Casey and Family Foundation, and the Bridge Project, a partnership between the Koch Institute and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>New hope for early pancreatic cancer intervention via AI-based risk prediction</title>

        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first documented case of pancreatic cancer dates back to the 18th century. Since then, researchers have undertaken a protracted and challenging odyssey to understand the elusive and deadly disease. To date, there is no better cancer treatment than early intervention. Unfortunately, the pancreas, nestled deep within the abdomen, is particularly elusive for early detection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) scientists, alongside Limor Appelbaum, a staff scientist in the Department of Radiation Oncology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), were eager to better identify potential high-risk patients. They set out to develop two machine-learning models for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common form of the cancer. To access a broad and diverse database, the team synced up with a federated network company, using electronic health record data from various institutions across the United States. This vast pool of data helped ensure the models' reliability and generalizability, making them applicable across a wide range of populations, geographical locations, and demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two models&amp;nbsp;&lt;a&gt;—&lt;/a&gt; the “PRISM” neural network, and the logistic regression model (a statistical technique for probability), outperformed current methods. The team’s comparison showed that while standard screening criteria identify about 10 percent of PDAC cases using a five-times higher relative risk threshold, Prism can detect 35 percent of PDAC cases at this same threshold.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using AI to detect cancer risk is not a new phenomena &lt;a&gt;—&lt;/a&gt; algorithms analyze mammograms, CT scans for lung cancer, and assist in the analysis of Pap smear tests and HPV testing, to name a few applications. “The PRISM models stand out for their development and validation on an extensive database of over 5 million patients, surpassing the scale of most prior research in the field,” says Kai Jia, an MIT PhD student in electrical engineering and computer science (EECS), MIT CSAIL affiliate, and first author on an open-access &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352396423004541" target="_blank"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;eBioMedicine &lt;/em&gt;outlining the new work&lt;/a&gt;. “The model uses routine clinical and lab data to make its predictions, and the diversity of the U.S. population is a significant advancement over other PDAC models, which are usually confined to specific geographic regions, like a few health-care centers in the U.S. Additionally, using a unique regularization technique in the training process enhanced the models' generalizability and interpretability.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This report outlines a powerful approach to use big data and artificial intelligence algorithms to refine our approach to identifying risk profiles for cancer,” says David Avigan, a Harvard Medical School professor and the cancer center director and chief of hematology and hematologic malignancies at BIDMC, who was not involved in the study. “This approach may lead to novel strategies to identify patients with high risk for malignancy that may benefit from focused screening with the potential for early intervention.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prismatic perspectives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The journey toward the development of PRISM began over six years ago, fueled by firsthand experiences with the limitations of current diagnostic practices. “Approximately 80-85 percent of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, where cure is no longer an option,” says senior author Appelbaum, who is also a Harvard Medical School instructor as well as radiation oncologist. “This clinical frustration sparked the idea to delve into the wealth of data available in electronic health records (EHRs).”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CSAIL group’s close collaboration with Appelbaum made it possible to understand the combined medical and machine learning aspects of the problem better, eventually leading to a much more accurate and transparent model. “The hypothesis was that these records contained hidden clues — subtle signs and symptoms that could act as early warning signals of pancreatic cancer,” she adds. “This guided our use of federated EHR networks in developing these models, for a scalable approach for deploying risk prediction tools in health care.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both PrismNN and PrismLR models analyze EHR data, including patient demographics, diagnoses, medications, and lab results, to assess PDAC risk. PrismNN uses artificial neural networks to detect intricate patterns in data features like age, medical history, and lab results, yielding a risk score for PDAC likelihood. PrismLR uses logistic regression for a simpler analysis, generating a probability score of PDAC based on these features. Together, the models offer a thorough evaluation of different approaches in predicting PDAC risk from the same EHR data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One paramount point for gaining the trust of physicians, the team notes, is better understanding how the models work, known in the field as interpretability. The scientists pointed out that while logistic regression models are inherently easier to interpret, recent advancements have made deep neural networks somewhat more transparent. This helped the team to refine the thousands of potentially predictive features derived from EHR of a single patient to approximately 85 critical indicators. These indicators, which include patient age, diabetes diagnosis, and an increased frequency of visits to physicians, are automatically discovered by the model but match physicians' understanding of risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The path forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the promise of the PRISM models, as with all research, some parts are still a work in progress. U.S. data alone are the current diet for the models, necessitating testing and adaptation for global use. The path forward, the team notes, includes expanding the model's applicability to international datasets and integrating additional biomarkers for more refined risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A subsequent aim for us is to facilitate the models' implementation in routine health care settings. The vision is to have these models function seamlessly in the background of health care systems, automatically analyzing patient data and alerting physicians to high-risk cases without adding to their workload,” says Jia. “A machine-learning model integrated with the EHR system could empower physicians with early alerts for high-risk patients, potentially enabling interventions well before symptoms manifest. We are eager to deploy our techniques in the real world to help all individuals enjoy longer, healthier lives.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jia wrote the paper alongside Applebaum and MIT EECS Professor and CSAIL Principal Investigator Martin Rinard, who are both senior authors of the paper. Researchers on the paper were supported during their time at MIT CSAIL, in part, by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Boeing, the National Science Foundation, and Aarno Labs. TriNetX provided resources for the project, and the Prevent Cancer Foundation also supported the team.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Inhalable sensors could enable early lung cancer detection</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/inhalable-sensors-early-lung-cancer-detection-0105</link>
  <description><![CDATA[The diagnostic, which requires only a simple urine test to read the results, could make lung cancer screening more accessible worldwide.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a new technology developed at MIT, diagnosing lung cancer could become as easy as inhaling nanoparticle sensors and then taking a urine test that reveals whether a tumor is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new diagnostic is based on nanosensors that can be delivered by an inhaler or a nebulizer. If the sensors encounter cancer-linked proteins in the lungs, they produce a signal that accumulates in the urine, where it can be detected with a simple paper test strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach could potentially replace or supplement the current gold standard for diagnosing lung cancer, low-dose computed tomography (CT). It could have an especially significant impact in low- and middle-income countries that don’t have widespread availability of CT scanners, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Around the world, cancer is going to become more and more prevalent in low- and middle-income countries. The epidemiology of lung cancer globally is that it’s driven by pollution and smoking, so we know that those are settings where accessibility to this kind of technology could have a big impact,” says Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, and a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhatia is the senior author of the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adj9591" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. Qian Zhong, an MIT research scientist, and Edward Tan, a former MIT postdoc, are the lead authors of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inhalable particles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help diagnose lung cancer as early as possible, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that heavy smokers over the age of 50 undergo annual CT scans. However, not everyone in this target group receives these scans, and the high false-positive rate of the scans can lead to unnecessary, invasive tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhatia has spent the last decade developing nanosensors for use in diagnosing cancer and other diseases, and in this study, she and her colleagues explored the possibility of using them as a more accessible alternative to CT screening for lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sensors consist of polymer nanoparticles coated with a reporter, such as a DNA barcode, that is cleaved from the particle when the sensor encounters enzymes called proteases, which are often overactive in tumors. Those reporters eventually accumulate in the urine and are excreted from the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of the sensors, which targeted other cancer sites such as the liver and ovaries, were designed to be given intravenously. For lung cancer diagnosis, the researchers wanted to create a version that could be inhaled, which could make it easier to deploy in lower resource settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we developed this technology, our goal was to provide a method that can detect cancer with high specificity and sensitivity, and also lower the threshold for accessibility, so that hopefully we can improve the resource disparity and inequity in early detection of lung cancer,” Zhong says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, the researchers created two formulations of their particles: a solution that can be aerosolized and delivered with a nebulizer, and a dry powder that can be delivered using an inhaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the particles reach the lungs, they are absorbed into the tissue, where they encounter any proteases that may be present. Human cells can express hundreds of different proteases, and some of them are overactive in tumors, where they help cancer cells to escape their original locations by cutting through proteins of the extracellular matrix. These cancerous proteases cleave DNA barcodes from the sensors, allowing the barcodes to circulate in the bloodstream until they are excreted in the urine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the earlier versions of this technology, the researchers used mass spectrometry to analyze the urine sample and detect DNA barcodes. However, mass spectrometry requires equipment that might not be available in low-resource areas, so for this version, the researchers created a lateral flow assay, which allows the barcodes to be detected using a paper test strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed the strip to detect up to four different DNA barcodes, each of which indicates the presence of a different protease. No pre-treatment or processing of the urine sample is required, and the results can be read about 20 minutes after the sample is obtained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were really pushing this assay to be point-of-care available in a low-resource setting, so the idea was to not do any sample processing, not do any amplification, just to be able to put the sample right on the paper and read it out in 20 minutes,” Bhatia says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate diagnosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested their diagnostic system in mice that are genetically engineered to develop lung tumors similar to those seen in humans. The sensors were administered 7.5 weeks after the tumors started to form, a time point that would likely correlate with stage 1 or 2 cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their first set of experiments in the mice, the researchers measured the levels of 20 different sensors designed to detect different proteases. Using a machine learning algorithm to analyze those results, the researchers identified a combination of just four sensors that was predicted to give accurate diagnostic results. They then tested that combination in the mouse model and found that it could accurately detect early-stage lung tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For use in humans, it’s possible that more sensors might be needed to make an accurate diagnosis, but that could be achieved by using multiple paper strips, each of which detects four different DNA barcodes, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers now plan to analyze human biopsy samples to see if the sensor panels they are using would also work to detect human cancers. In the longer term, they hope to perform clinical trials in human patients. A company called Sunbird Bio has already run phase 1 trials on a similar sensor developed by Bhatia’s lab, for use in diagnosing liver cancer and a form of hepatitis known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parts of the world where there is limited access to CT scanning, this technology could offer a dramatic improvement in lung cancer screening, especially since the results can be obtained during a single visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The idea would be you come in and then you get an answer about whether you need a follow-up test or not, and we could get patients who have early lesions into the system so that they could get curative surgery or lifesaving medicines,” Bhatia says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Lung Cancer Initiative, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Koch Institute Support (core) Grant from the National Cancer Institute, and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional related work was supported by the Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicine and the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via Upstage Lung Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Study: Colon cancer screenings are more effective than previously understood</title>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Screening for colon cancer reduces cancer rates by substantially more than previous analyses of randomized trials suggest, according to a study co-authored by an MIT economist that takes a new look at data from five trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly 1 percent of participants in a given trial get colon cancer in the decade following the trial. The new findings, based on data from trials in half a dozen countries, show that screening reduces this rate by about 0.5 percentage points. That is twice the impact previously estimated; earlier studies placed the screening effect at around a quarter of a percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The effect of actually getting screened is about half a percentage point, double previously published results which focus on the effect of being invited to screen,” says MIT econometrician Josh Angrist. The large size of this effect relative to the baseline enhances the case for colorectal (CRC) screening, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The findings are important, Angrist says, because many trial subjects offered the chance to screen via colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy decide to skip it. Prior studies fail to properly account for such “nonadherence” to the intended treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Nonadherence is widespread in randomized clinical trials, especially those offering relatively unpleasant interventions like CRC screening,” Angrist says. “Offers of a free colonoscopy are not always taken up with enthusiasm.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poses a problem for trial analysis because, while offers to screen are randomly assigned in randomized screening trials, the decision to screen may be far from random.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="http://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311556120" target="_blank"&gt;Instrumental Variable Methods Reconcile Intention-To-Screen Effects Across Pragmatic Cancer Screening Trials&lt;/a&gt;,” was published Friday in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. The authors are Angrist, the Ford Professor of Economics at MIT, and Peter Hull PhD ’17, a professor of economics at Brown University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting screened, not just being invited to screen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of cancer screening is the focus of an active research literature. It might seem that getting screened for cancer is always important, but many complicating factors, including the potential for false positives and consequent overtreatment, motivate research into the benefits and costs of such procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Angrist and Hull study examines data from five major randomized clinical trials of screenings for colorectal cancer. Four of the screenings used sigmoidoscopies (partial colonoscopies), while one offered full colonoscopies. All the trials were randomized, with a randomly selected treatment group offered screening and a control group that remained mostly screened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each trial, however, the number of participants in the treatment group who actually got screened varied widely, from 42 percent to 87 percent, well below the number offered the chance to screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In many clinical trials, there can be quite a few people who aren’t treated as planned,” Angrist says. “Cancer screening trials are a setting where that’s especially problematic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier studies focus on comparisons based on randomly assigned screening offers, with no proper adjustment for how many people actually got screened. The core of the new analysis adjusts intention-to-screen effects to produce valid measures of the effect on people who were actually screened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The adjustment uses an econometric method called “instrumental variables” — “IV,” to economists — that in this case captures the effect of screening on those who were screened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Cancer screening trials, with their substantial nonadherence to the treatment protocol, are really an ideal scenario for IV,” Angrist says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new analysis also resolves a key puzzle in the earlier studies: the variablility in findings across trials. Angrist and Hull found that IV estimates from the five trials align remarkably well, showing a fairly consistent 0.5 percentage point decrease in cancer incidence among those who were screened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Across five different trials and a bunch of subgroups, the results do fall on a line, even though the ITS effects were quite different across the trials” Angrist says, referring to estimates focusing on effects of screening offers. “Once you do the adherence adjustment, they cluster around half a percent.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the tool kit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angrist is a longtime econometrician who has worked to upgrade the tools social scientists use to estimate causal effects in wide-ranging domains including education, labor economics, health care, and more. His methods have also been adopted by some biostatisticians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But not enough,” Angrist says. “Peter Hull and I set out to show the power of IV to generate new findings in this important area.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angrist shared the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/mit-economist-joshua-angrist-shares-nobel-prize-1011" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Nobel Prize in Economics&lt;/a&gt; with David Card of the University of California at Berkeley and Guido Imbens of Stanford University for their work on econometric tools. Angrist’s Nobel citation describes his theoretical work with Imbens on IV, which showed for the first time that IV methods capture something called a “local average treatment effects.”&amp;nbsp;In the context of CRC screening trials, this is simply the average effect of screening on the screened. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angrist and Hull conclude their paper with a call to make IV analysis a routine part of clinical research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you want to encourage a reluctant colonoscopy patient, you shouldn’t tell them the effect of being invited to screen, you should tell them the effect of actually being screened,” Angrist says. “And that’s a much bigger number.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>MIT’s tiny technologies go to Washington</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-tiny-technologies-go-to-washington-1218</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Cancer nanomedicine was on display at the 2023 White House Demo Day.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 12:45:00 -0500</pubDate>

        <dc:creator>Koch Institute</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 7, a team from the Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicine at MIT showed a Washington audience several examples of how nanotechnologies developed at the Institute can transform the detection and treatment of cancer and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team was one of 40 innovative groups featured at “American Possibilities: A White House Demo Day.” Technology on view spanned energy, artificial intelligence, climate, and health, highlighting advancements that contribute to building a better future for all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants included President Joe Biden, Biden-Harris administration leaders and White House staff, members of Congress, federal R&amp;amp;D funding agencies, scientists and engineers, academics, students, and science and technology industry innovators. The event holds special significance for MIT as eight years ago, MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory participated in the last iteration of the White House Demo Day under President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was truly inspirational hearing from experts from all across the government, the private sector, and academia touching on so many fields,” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/11/14/remarks-by-president-biden-on-actions-to-address-the-climate-crisis/#:~:text=It%20was%20truly%20inspirational%20hearing,It's%20just%20like%20your%20hand." target="_blank"&gt;said President Biden&lt;/a&gt; of the event. “It was a reminder, at least for me, of what I’ve long believed — that America can be defined by a single word... possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launched in 2016, the Marble Center for Cancer Nanomedicine was established at the Koch Institute for Integrative Research at MIT to serve as a hub for miniaturized biomedical technologies, especially those that address grand challenges in cancer detection, treatment, and monitoring. The center convenes Koch Institute faculty members Sangeeta Bhatia, Paula Hammond, Robert Langer, Angela Belcher, Darrell Irvine, and Daniel Anderson to advance nanomedicine, as well as to facilitate collaboration with industry partners, including Alloy Therapeutics, Danaher Corp., Fujifilm, and Sanofi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ana Jaklenec, a principal research scientist at the Koch Institute, highlighted several groundbreaking technologies in vaccines and disease diagnostics and treatment at the event. Jaklenec gave demonstrations from projects from her research group, including novel vaccine formulations capable of releasing a dozen booster doses pulsed over predetermined time points, microneedle vaccine technologies, and nutrient delivery technologies for precise control over microbiome modulation and nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jaklenec describes the event as “a wonderful opportunity to meet our government leaders and policymakers and see their passion for curing cancer. But it was especially moving to interact with people representing diverse communities across the United States and hear their excitement for how our technologies could positively impact their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Li, a former MIT postdoc, presented a technology developed in the Belcher laboratory and commercialized by the spinout &lt;a href="https://cisionvision.com/"&gt;Cision Vision&lt;/a&gt;. The startup is developing a new approach to visualize lymph nodes in real time without any injection or radiation. The shoebox-sized device was also selected as part of &lt;em&gt;Time Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/best-inventions-2023/6324321/cisionvision-invision/"&gt;Best Inventions of 2023&lt;/a&gt; and is currently being used in a dozen hospitals across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a proud moment for Cision Vision to be part of this event and discuss our recent progress in the field of medical imaging and cancer care,” says Li, who is a co-founder and the CEO of CisionVision. “It was a humbling experience for us to hear directly from patient advocates and cancer survivors at the event. We feel more inspired than ever to bring better solutions for cancer care to patients around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other technologies shown at the event included new approaches such as a tortoise-shaped pill designed to enhance the efficacy of oral medicines, a miniature organ-on-a-chip liver device to predict drug toxicity and model liver disease, and a wireless bioelectronic device that provides oxygen for cell therapy applications and for the treatment of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The feedback from the organizers and the audience at the event has been overwhelmingly positive,” says Tarek Fadel, who led the team’s participation at the event. “Navigating the demonstration space felt like stepping into the future. As a center, we stand poised to engineer transformative tools that will truly make a difference for the future of cancer care.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sangeeta Bhatia, the Director of the Marble Center and the John J. and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, adds: “The showcase of our technologies at the White House Demo Day underscores the transformative impact we aim to achieve in cancer detection and treatment. The event highlights our vision to advance cutting-edge solutions for the benefit of patients and communities worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Angela Belcher delivers 2023 Dresselhaus Lecture on evolving organisms for new nanomaterials</title>

  <description><![CDATA[MIT professor combines nanoscience and viruses to develop solutions in energy, environment, and medicine.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/angela-belcher-delivers-dresselhaus-lecture-1213</guid>
        <dc:creator>Amanda Stoll DiCristofaro | MIT.nano</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“How do we get to making nanomaterials that haven’t been evolved before?” asked &lt;a href="https://be.mit.edu/directory/angela-belcher" target="_blank"&gt;Angela Belcher&lt;/a&gt; at the 2023 Mildred S. Dresselhaus Lecture at MIT on Nov. 20. “We can use elements that biology has already given us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The combined in-person and virtual audience of over 300 was treated to a light-up, 3D model of M13 bacteriophage, a virus that only infects bacteria, complete with a pull-out strand of DNA. Belcher used the feather-boa-like model to show how her research group modifies the M13’s genes to add new DNA and peptide sequences to template inorganic materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I love controlling materials at the nanoscale using biology,” said Belcher, the James Mason Crafts Professor of Biological Engineering, materials science professor, and of the Koch Institute of Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. “We all know if you control materials at the nanoscale and you can start to tune them, then you can have all kinds of different applications.” And the opportunities are indeed vast — from building batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells to carbon sequestration and storage, environmental remediation, catalysis, and medical diagnostics and imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belcher sprinkled her talk with models and props, lined up on a table at the front of the 10-250 lecture hall, to demonstrate a wide variety of concepts and projects made possible by the intersection of biology and nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy storage and environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How do you go from a DNA sequence to a functioning battery?” posed Belcher. Grabbing a model of a large carbon nanotube, she explained how her group engineered a phage to pick up carbon nanotubes that would wind all the way around the virus and then fill in with different cathode or anode materials to make nanowires for battery electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about using the M13 bacteriophage to improve the environment? Belcher referred to a project by former student Geran Zhang PhD ’19 that proved the virus can be modified for this context, too. He used the phage to template high-surface-area, carbon-based materials that can grab small molecules and break them down, Belcher said, opening a realm of possibilities from cleaning up rivers to developing chemical warfare agents to combating smog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belcher’s lab worked with the U.S. Army to produce protective clothing and masks made of these carbon-based virus nanofibers. “We went from five liters in our lab to a thousand liters, then 10,000 liters in the army labs where we’re able to make kilograms of the material,” Belcher said, stressing the importance of being able to test and prototype at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imaging tools and therapeutics in cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the area of biomedical imaging, Belcher explained, a lot less is known in near-infrared imaging — imaging in wavelengths above 1,000 nanometers — than other imaging techniques, yet with near-infrared scientists can see much deeper inside the body. Belcher’s lab built their own systems to image at these wavelengths. The third generation of this system provides real-time, sub-millimeter optical imaging for guided surgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with Sangeeta Bhatia, the John J. and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Engineering, Belcher used carbon nanotubes to build imaging tools that find tiny tumors during surgery that doctors otherwise would not be able to see. The tool is actually a virus engineered to carry with it a fluorescent, single-walled carbon nanotube as it seeks out the tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearing the end of her talk, Belcher presented a goal: to develop an accessible detection and diagnostic technology for ovarian cancer in five to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We think that we can do it,” Belcher said. She described her students’ work developing a way to scan an entire fallopian tube, as opposed to just one small portion, to find pre-cancer lesions, and talked about the team of MIT faculty, doctors, and researchers working collectively toward this goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Part of the secret of life and the meaning of life is helping other people enjoy the passage of time,” said Belcher in her closing remarks. “I think that we can all do that by working to solve some of the biggest issues on the planet, including helping to diagnose and treat ovarian cancer early so people have more time to spend with their family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honoring Mildred S. Dresselhaus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belcher was the fifth speaker to deliver the &lt;a href="https://mitnano.mit.edu/mitnano-seminar-series/dresselhaus-lecture"&gt;Dresselhaus Lecture&lt;/a&gt;, an annual event organized by MIT.nano to honor the late MIT physics and electrical engineering Institute Professor Mildred Dresselhaus. The lecture features a speaker from anywhere in the world whose leadership and impact echo Dresselhaus’s life, accomplishments, and values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Millie was and is a huge hero of mine,” said Belcher. “Giving a lecture in Millie’s name is just the greatest honor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belcher dedicated the talk to Dresselhaus, whom she described with an array of accolades — a trailblazer, a genius, an amazing mentor, teacher, and inventor. “Just knowing her was such a privilege,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belcher also dedicated her talk to her own grandmother and mother, both of whom passed away from cancer, as well as late MIT professors Susan Lindquist and Angelika Amon, who both died of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been so fortunate to work with just the most talented and dedicated graduate students, undergraduate students, postdocs, and researchers,” concluded Belcher. “It has been a pure joy to be in partnership with all of you to solve these very daunting problems.”&lt;/p&gt;

        <dc:creator>Leah Campbell | School of Science</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the narrowest sense, glycobiology is the study of the structure, biology, and evolution of glycans, the carbohydrates and sugar-coated molecules found in every living organism. As a recent &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/glycomit-symposium-celebrates-advancements-glycobiology-1107"&gt;symposium at MIT&lt;/a&gt; made clear, the field is in the midst of a renaissance that could reshape scientists' understanding of the building blocks of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally coined in the 1980s to describe the merging of traditional research in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry, glycobiology has come to encompass a much broader and multidisciplinary set of ideas. “Glycoscience” may actually be a more appropriate name for the rapidly growing field, reflecting its broad application not just to biology and chemistry but also to bioengineering, medicine, materials science, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s becoming increasingly clear that these glycans have a very important role to play in health and disease,” says Laura Kiessling, the Novartis Professor of Chemistry. “It may seem daunting initially, but devising new tools and identifying new kinds of interactions requires exactly the sort of creative problem-solving skills that people have at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sugar coat of the body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glycans include a diverse set of molecules with linear and branched structures that are critical for basic biological functions. With no known exception, all cells in nature are coated with these sugar molecules — from the intricate chains of sugars surrounding most cellular surfaces to the conjugated molecules formed when sugars attach like scaffolding to lipids and proteins. They’re absolutely fundamental to life. For example, Kiessling points out that the most abundant organic molecule on the planet is the carbohydrate cellulose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sperm-egg binding is mediated by an interaction between a protein and a carbohydrate,” she says. “None of us would exist without these interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though talking about carbs and sugars might leave some people focused on their diet, glycans are actually among the most important biomolecules out there. They store energy and, in some cases like cellulose, provide the structural framework for multicellular organisms. They mediate communication between cells; influence interactions like that between a host and parasite; and shape immune responses, disease progression, development, and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It turns out that some of these structures, which we didn’t even know existed in the body in such abundance until recently, have so many different biological functions,” says Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Biological Engineering Katharina Ribbeck. “With this rapid expansion of knowledge, it feels like we’re just beginning to understand how diverse and important those functions are to biology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a better understanding of how ubiquitous and critical these molecules are, researchers in applied fields like biotechnology and medicine have turned their attention to glycoscience as a tool to pinpoint the drivers of disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many conditions have been linked to defects in how glycans are produced in the body or issues with glycosylation, the process by which carbohydrates attach to proteins and other molecules. That includes certain forms of cancer. Cancer cells have even been shown to cloak themselves in certain glycoproteins to evade an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, glycans may be a repository of potential therapeutics. The blood thinner Heparin, one of the world’s best-selling prescription drugs, for example, is a carbohydrate-based drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glycans and sugar-binding proteins like lectins even help influence the exchange of microbes across mucus layers in the human body, from the brain to the gut. Glycans dangling off mucus interact with microbes, letting good ones in and reducing the virulence of problematic ones by interrupting cell signaling or stopping pathogens from releasing toxins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New tools to advance old science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite how crucial this “sugar coat” is, for a long time, molecular biologists focused on nucleic acids and proteins, paying relatively little attention to the sugars that coated them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The tools we have to examine the functions of other molecules are largely absent for glycans,” says Kiessling, who is also an institute member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the DNA and RNA sequences of a cell predict what proteins that cell makes, so scientists can track where a protein is and what it’s doing using a genetically-encoded tag. But the structure of glycans isn’t so obviously encoded in a cell’s DNA, and a single protein can be decorated with many different chains of carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the immense diversity of forms carbohydrates can take, and the fact that they break down quickly in the bloodstream, has made it challenging to synthesize glycans or target them for drug development. So, creative new methods are needed to track them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a classic chicken-and-egg situation. As scientists better understand the importance of glycans for so many biological processes, it has incentivized them to develop better tools for studying glycans, in turn, producing even more data on just what these molecules can do. In 2022, in fact, the Nobel Prize was awarded to Carolyn Bertozzi at Stanford University, a pioneer in glycobiology, for her work on tracking molecules in cells, which she and others have applied to glycans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But artificial intelligence could facilitate an evolutionary leap in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think glycobiology is, more than almost any other field, ripe and ready for an AI interpretation,” Ribbeck says, explaining how AI might enable scientists to read the “glycan code” in the same way they have with the human genome. That would allow researchers to predict the actual function of a glycan based on data about its structure. From there, they could identify what changes lead to disease or increase disease susceptibility — and, most importantly, come up with ways to repair those defects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An inter- and trans-disciplinary effort&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increasing interest in computation reflects the inherent interdisciplinarity that has defined glycoscience from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just at MIT, for example, related research is happening across the Institute. Kiessling describes MIT as a “playground for interdisciplinary research,” which has enabled significant advances in the field with applications to biotechnology, cancer research, brain science, immunology, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Department of Chemistry, Kiessling is studying carbohydrate-binding proteins, and how their interactions with glycans affect the immune system. She’s also working with Bryan Bryson, an associate professor in the Department of Biological Engineering, and Deborah Hung, a core faculty member at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, using carbohydrate analogs to test differences in strains of tuberculosis in South Africa. Meanwhile, assistant professor of biological engineering Jessica Stark is pioneering approaches to better understand the roles of glycans in the immune system. Tobi Oni, a fellow at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, is looking to glycans to help detect and target tumors in pancreatic cancer. Barbara Imperiali, the Class of 1922 Professor of Biology and Chemistry, is studying the carbohydrates that envelop the cells of microbes like bacteria, and Professor Matthew Shoulders in the Department of Chemistry is studying the role of glycans in synthesizing and folding proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re at a very exciting and unique position combining disciplines to address and answer entirely new questions relevant for disease and health,” says Ribbeck.”The field in and of itself is not new, but what is new is the contribution that MIT, in particular, could make with a creative combination of science, engineering, and computation.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Immune action at a distance</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2023/immune-action-distance-1130</link>
  <description><![CDATA[MIT and MGH researchers design a local, gel-based drug-delivery platform that may provoke a system-wide immune response to metastatic tumors.]]></description>
  <pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2023 09:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For most metastatic cancer types, there are no reliably effective treatments. Therapies may slow the growth of tumors, but they will not eradicate them. Occasionally, however, treating a tumor in one location will cause untreated tumors elsewhere in the body to shrink or even regress completely — a dramatic but exceedingly rare phenomenon known as the abscopal effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cancer researchers have sought methods to induce the abscopal effect by design. The abscopal effect is thought to arise when dead or damaged tumor cells release antigens that teach some types of immune cells to recognize and attack other and even distant cancer cells. Essentially, the treated tumor behaves like a personalized cancer vaccine that incites the immune system to attack metastasized tumors. The advent of cancer immunoadjuvants, which enhance and sustain the activity of tumor-targeting immune cells, has been a key to unlocking the abscopal effect, at least in the laboratory setting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the clinic, success has proven more elusive. Since immunotherapies can lead to serious toxicities if administered through the bloodstream, they must be delivered directly to the tumor — often by injection. It is difficult for clinicians to target injections precisely to the tumor and impossible to confirm delivery. Once injected, immunostimulatory drugs quickly leak out of the tumor before they have had a chance to take full effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers, together with colleagues from Mass General Brigham, have developed a polymer gel delivery system that could help translate the promise of the abscopal effect into the clinic. The gel, visible with a CT scanner or ultrasound, solidifies after injection, where it remains in the tumor to release drugs at a controlled rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;, the team delivered the immune-stimulating drug imiquimod in combination with checkpoint blockade therapy to dual-tumor mouse models of colon and breast cancer, which showed improved survival as well as tumor regression in both treated and untreated tumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The field has been seeking the ‘holy grail’ of the abscopal effect for the past 15 years,” says Giovanni Traverso, a senior author of the study, Karl Van Tassel Career Development Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, and a member of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT. “Now, with drug-delivery materials better adapted for the clinic, it could be within reach.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traverso’s co-senior author is Umar Mahmood, director of the Center for Precision Imaging and chief of the Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Avik Som, interventional and diagnostic radiology resident at MGH; Jan-Georg Rosenboom, senior postdoc in the Langer and Traverso labs at the Koch Institute; and&amp;nbsp; Eric Wehrenberg-Klee, director of the Center for Image-Guided Cancer Therapy and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, are co-lead authors. Robert Langer, David H. Koch Institute Professor, is also an author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At MGH, clinicians saw that of 18 patients that were treated with an intratumoral injection of immunotherapy either just before or after undergoing a procedure known as cryoablation, one patient with metastatic melanoma showed a sustained abscopal effect. In cryoablation, a tumor is injected with freezing gas and then thawed out, with the hope of inducing a system-wide immune response to tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The observation pointed to a promising avenue for achieving the abscopal effect for more patients, but a new tool was needed to address some of the realities of intratumoral injections in the clinic. In addition to the difficulties of delivering intratumoral injections for the clinician, these treatments are costly and infeasible for patients. Because tumors do not retain immunotherapies for long, patients require repeat injections — with sedation — over several days. The clinicians looked across the river to their MIT colleagues for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“My clinical colleagues came to us with this very interesting problem, so we thought, how can we address this from our own chemical engineering perspective?” says Rosenboom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interdisciplinary team determined that the injected material would need to be liquid at room temperature during injection, and then solidify once inside the tumor to prevent leakage. For optimal drug delivery, the gel would need to carry a high concentration of drug in a small volume and then release its payload in a controlled fashion over several days. The team planned to add an iodinated and clinically approved contrast agent to make it visible with a CT scan to help clinicians confirm they have successfully injected the material. To help smooth the path of the platform to the clinic, the gel should be known to be safe and biocompatible and the immunotherapy it transports to have proven effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As a radiologist, I can see tumors under CT or ultrasound, but I can't see the drugs they are asking me to inject!” says Som. “That's why we designed a formulation for a promising immunoadjuvant that could be image guided by both modalities. This platform should hopefully realize the immense promise of personalized cancer vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds Wehrenberg-Klee, “When developing new intratumoral immunotherapies, being able to confirm delivery into tumor is a critical variable. Intratumoral immunotherapy relies on the assumption that you are delivering therapy to tumor, but our clinical experience suggests this may not always be true. If we can see what we’ve injected, we can eliminate that concern.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As engineers, we needed to solve the problem of how to tune a polymer formulation to achieve injectability, solidification at body temperature, prolonged drug release, and visibility — all at the same time, all while these properties affect one another,” says Rosenboom. “That took us about four years to figure out.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A solution gels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After investigating several polymers, the researchers found that a three-part polymer called PLGA-PEG-PLGA would help them balance the several competing features required of their platform. The polymer is thermosensitive. With slight changes to its molecular weight (size), it can be adjusted to be liquid at room temperature during injection and more viscous in the warmer environment of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polymer is also amphiphilic, with a PEG block that is attracted to water and two PLGA blocks that repel water, so that it forms a nanoparticle around the hydrophobic drug. Its amphiphilic properties allow its drug-release behaviors to be precisely tuned: the more hydrophobic the PLGA block, the slower the release. The formulation allowed a slowed drug release over four to five days, which was a timeframe previously reported to be effective when injected daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar version of the polymer has already been studied in clinical trials for delivering a type of chemotherapy, paclitaxel. However, in this scenario, the gel would transport imiquimod, an immunotherapy already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that is commonly used topically to treat basal cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the gel had been tailored to meet their requirements, the team tested it in mouse models of colon and breast cancer that are usually resistant to immunotherapy. In combination with a type of immunotherapy called checkpoint blockade therapy, they used the platform to deliver imiquimod. Each mouse had two tumors of the same type, but only one tumor was treated. If both tumors regressed, then the researchers could confirm their platform could induce a system-wide immune response to tumors — the abscopal effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the combination of checkpoint blockade therapy and intratumorally delivered imiquimod resulted in improved survival in both colon and breast cancer models. The treatment resulted in an all-or-nothing response, with complete regression of both the treated and untreated tumors in the mice that did respond to therapy. For nonresponders, there was no regression in either tumor. The researchers also tested the combination therapy of gel-delivered imiquimod and checkpoint blockade therapy with and without cryoablation of the treated tumor and found that the two approaches gave similar results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the platform is made from safe materials to deliver an already-approved drug, the team expects that the path to FDA approval will be significantly shorter than for completely novel platforms and therapies. The team is also working with industry partners to adapt the platform for treating other tumor types and to deliver other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study was funded in part by a Philips RSNA Research Award, a Schlaeger Research Fellowship, a postdoctoral fellowship from the Ludwig Center at the Koch Institute, and grants from Boston Scientific, the MIT Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>A new ultrasound patch can measure how full your bladder is</title>

        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT researchers have designed a wearable ultrasound monitor, in the form of a patch, that can image organs within the body without the need for an ultrasound operator or application of gel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a new study, the researchers showed that their patch can accurately image the bladder and determine how full it is. This could help patients with bladder or kidney disorders more easily track whether these organs are functioning properly, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach could also be adapted to monitor other organs within the body by changing the location of the ultrasound array and tuning the frequency of the signal. Such devices could potentially enable earlier detection of cancers that form deep within the body, such as ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This technology is versatile and can be used not only on the bladder but any deep tissue of the body. It’s a novel platform that can do identification and characterization of many of the diseases that we carry in our body,” says Canan Dagdeviren, an associate professor in MIT’s Media Lab and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lin Zhang, an MIT research scientist; Colin Marcus, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science; and Dabin Lin, a professor at Xi’an Technological University, are the lead authors of a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-023-01068-x"&gt;paper describing the work&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Electronics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wearable monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dagdeviren’s lab, which specializes in designing flexible, wearable electronic devices, recently developed an &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/wearable-ultrasound-scanner-breast-cancer-0728"&gt;ultrasound monitor&lt;/a&gt; that can be incorporated into a bra and used to screen for breast cancer. In the new study, the team used a similar approach to develop a wearable patch that can adhere to the skin and take ultrasound images of organs located within the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For their first demonstration, the researchers decided to focus on the bladder, partly inspired by Dagdeviren’s younger brother, who was diagnosed with kidney cancer a few years ago. After having one of his kidneys surgically removed, he had difficulty fully emptying his bladder. Dagdeviren wondered if an ultrasound monitor that reveals how full the bladder is might help patients similar to her brother, or people with other types of bladder or kidney problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Millions of people are suffering from bladder dysfunction and related diseases, and not surprisingly, bladder volume monitoring is an effective way to assess your kidney health and wellness,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only way to measure bladder volume is using a traditional, bulky ultrasound probe, which requires going to a medical facility. Dagdeviren and her colleagues wanted to develop a wearable alternative that patients could use at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve that, they created a flexible patch made of silicone rubber, embedded with five ultrasound arrays made from a new piezoelectric material that the researchers developed for this device. The arrays are positioned in the shape of a cross, which allows the patch to image the entire bladder, which is about 12 by 8 centimeters when full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The polymer that makes up the patch is naturally sticky and adheres gently to the skin, making it easy to attach and detach. Once placed on the skin, underwear or leggings can help to hold it in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bladder volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study performed with collaborators at the Center for Ultrasound Research and Translation and Department of Radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, the researchers showed that the new patch could capture images comparable to those taken with a traditional ultrasound probe, and these images could be used to track changes in bladder volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers recruited 20 patients with a range of body mass indexes. Subjects were first imaged with a full bladder, then with a partially empty bladder, and then with a completely empty bladder. The images obtained from the new patch were similar in quality to those taken with traditional ultrasound, and the ultrasound arrays worked on all subjects regardless of their body mass index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this patch, no ultrasound gel is needed, and no pressure needs to be applied, as with a regular ultrasound probe, because the field of view is large enough to encompass the entire bladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the images, the researchers connected their ultrasound arrays to the same kind of ultrasound machine used in medical imaging centers. However, the MIT team is now working on a portable device, about the size of a smartphone, that could be used to view the images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In this work, we have further developed a path toward clinical translation of conformable ultrasonic biosensors that yield valuable information about vital physiologic parameters. Our group hopes to build on this and develop a suite of devices that will ultimately bridge the information gap between clinicians and patients,” says Anthony E. Samir, director of the MGH Center for Ultrasound Research and Translation and Associate Chair of Imaging Sciences at MGH Radiology, who is also an author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT team also hopes to develop ultrasound devices that could be used to image other organs within the body, such as the pancreas, liver, or ovaries. Based on the location and depth of each organ, the researchers need to alter the frequency of the ultrasound signal, which requires designing new piezoelectric materials. For some of these organs, located deep within the body, the device may work better as an implant rather than a wearable patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For whatever organ that we need to visualize, we go back to the first step, select the right materials, come up with the right device design and then fabricate everything accordingly,” before testing the device and performing clinical trials, Dagdeviren says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This work could develop into a central area of focus in ultrasound research, motivate a new approach to future medical device designs, and lay the groundwork for many more fruitful collaborations between materials scientists, electrical engineers, and biomedical researchers,” says Anantha Chandrakasan, dean of MIT’s School of Engineering, the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by a National Science Foundation CAREER award, a 3M Non-Tenured Faculty Award, the Sagol Weizmann-MIT Bridge Program, Texas Instruments Inc., the MIT Media Lab Consortium, a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, and an ARRS Scholar Award.&lt;/p&gt;

  <description><![CDATA[High schooler Dustin Liang estimated his blood cell counts by applying knowledge from an MITx course and talking to doctors.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2023/teen-uses-calculus-learned-through-mitx-better-understand-his-cancer-treatment-1103</guid>
        <dc:creator>Sara Feijo | MIT Open Learning</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When Dustin Liang was diagnosed with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in June, the cancer consumed his life. But despite a monthlong hospital stay, aggressive chemotherapy treatments, and ongoing headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and nausea, the 17-year-old high school senior enrolled in &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;’s class 18.01.1x (Calculus 1A: Differentiation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://openlearning.mit.edu/courses-programs/mitx-courses?f%5B0%5D=course_availability%3A62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, part of MIT Open Learning, offers hundreds of high-quality massive open online courses adapted from the MIT classroom for learners worldwide. The Calculus 1A: Differentiation course was designed and created by the Department of Mathematics and offered through the &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; program. Liang took the free course this summer in between treatment sessions and medical tests so that he could meet the four-year math requirement to graduate from a Massachusetts high school — an arrangement he made with his school.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In class, Liang learned how to differentiate functions and how to make linear and quadratic approximations. He then applied this knowledge to estimate his blood cell counts. “I was in a hospital bed when I saw the doctor draw a graph of my neutrophils on a whiteboard, and I thought you could apply a quadratic approximation to it to estimate my blood cell counts at a certain time in the future,” Liang recalls. “I talked to the doctors about it, and they said it was a good idea but that they currently didn’t have the technology to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When doctors conduct blood tests on a patient, they look at multiple cell counts. Three of those are especially important for cancer patients: hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells responsible for the delivery of oxygen to tissues; platelets, tiny blood cells that help the body form clots to stop bleeding; and neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps the body fight infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Heavy chemo kills all of the cells, regardless of whether they’re good or bad,” says Thomas Liang MS ’97, who is Dustin Liang’s father. “We asked the doctor a few times about the nadir [the lowest value of the neutrophil count after drug administration], but the doctors couldn't predict when Dustin would get to it. The anxiety was pretty high.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Liang was in the intensive care unit, his doctors ordered blood tests hourly to get a clearer picture of his blood cell counts. Being able to predict blood cell counts allows doctors to more accurately manage the next treatment procedure, and it allows patients and their caregivers to be more cautious and prepare for the next treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predicting neutrophil counts with math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After being hospitalized for weeks, Liang couldn’t wait to go home. He had his eyes locked on his absolute neutrophil count, which needed to reach 1,000 per microliter of blood in order for Liang to get discharged.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Calculus 1A, Liang was learning how to predict the near future value of a function using linear or quadratic approximation methods. After seeing a doctor’s chart of his neutrophils, Liang hypothesized that he could use quadratic approximation to predict his neutrophil count.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Given a series of points of the blood cell counts, a function can be modeled,” Liang explains. “So, predicting a future point not far away is mathematically feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determined to test his idea, Liang called his mentor, Jiawen Sun, who works in a London security exchange firm as a trading analyst simulating and modeling stock market behavior. Sun helped Liang create a graph to estimate Liang’s neutrophil count at a certain time. When Liang compared the graph to his blood test results, he found that the math worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was able to predict the blood cell counts. It was a little off, but close enough,” Liang says. “There are some challenges in simulating the function of blood cells. However, the human blood cell counts turned out to be converging easier than the stock market to simulate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, Liang is working on a more accurate model for the neutrophil count based on input he received from doctors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He hopes to use data from other cancer patients to test his model; however, much more work will be needed to determine if this kind of model can be used on other patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If this works, it will alleviate some of the anxiety of cancer patients, and make their lives a little bit easier,” Liang says. “For doctors, they will be able to come up with more accurate procedures for treating cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for better treatment options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liang completed Calculus 1A: Differentiation in September, receiving a grade of 100 percent on his final exam. “My other chemo had started, and I was feeling pretty bad when my dad told me the grade,” he recalls. “I’m proud I managed to accomplish something while I was undergoing chemo.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liang, who continues to undergo chemotherapy treatment, enrolled in class 18.01.2x (Calculus 1B: Integration) through &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; this fall semester. He is also taking an English class at his high school. After graduating from high school next year, Liang wants to study pre-med and become a cancer researcher.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was always pretty interested in the science field. Then I got cancer, and I got even more interested in it,” he says. “I want to research it, find ways to help people get rid of their cancer, and better patients’ treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Thomas Liang, his son’s survival is the first priority. “I want him to be a successful survivor,” he says. “Dustin is a brilliant kid and a chess prodigy. He thinks fast. He’s very sensitive. He doesn’t talk a lot, but is very popular among his friends. He's a kindhearted kid. I am proud of his aspirations to be a doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;

He is developing a multimodal representation learning approach that aligns knowledge captured in large amounts of medical image and text data to transfer this knowledge to new tasks and applications. Supported by a Takeda Fellowship, Wang will advance this promising line of work to build robust tools that interpret images, learn from sparse human feedback, and reason like doctors, with potentially major benefits to important stakeholders in health care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oscar Wu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haoyang “Oscar” Wu is a PhD candidate in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Wu’s research integrates quantum chemistry and deep learning methods to accelerate the process of small-molecule screening in the development of new drugs. By identifying and automating reliable methods for finding transition state geometries and calculating barrier heights for new reactions, Wu’s work could make it possible to conduct the high-throughput ab initio calculations of reaction rates needed to screen the reactivity of large numbers of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). A Takeda Fellowship will support his current project to: (1) develop open-source software for high-throughput quantum chemistry calculations, focusing on the reactivity of drug-like molecules, and (2) develop deep learning models that can quantitatively predict the oxidative stability of APIs. The tools and insights resulting from Wu’s research could help to transform and accelerate the drug-discovery process, offering significant benefits to the pharmaceutical and medical fields and to patients.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soojung Yang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soojung Yang is a PhD candidate in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. Yang’s research applies cutting-edge methods in geometric deep learning and generative modeling, along with atomistic simulations, to better understand and model protein dynamics. Specifically, Yang is developing novel tools in generative AI to explore protein conformational landscapes that offer greater speed and detail than physics-based simulations at a substantially lower cost. With the support of a Takeda Fellowship, she will build upon her successful work on the reverse transformation of coarse-grained proteins to the all-atom resolution, aiming to build machine-learning models that bridge multiple size scales of protein conformation diversity (all-atom, residue-level, and domain-level). Yang’s research holds the potential to provide a powerful and widely applicable new tool for researchers who seek to understand the complex protein functions at work in human diseases and to design drugs to treat and cure those diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yuzhe Yang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yuzhe Yang is a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Yang’s research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and health care. In his past and current work, Yang has developed and applied innovative machine-learning models that address key challenges in disease diagnosis and tracking. His many notable achievements include the creation of one of the first machine learning-based solutions using nocturnal breathing signals to detect Parkinson’s disease (PD), estimate disease severity, and track PD progression. With the support of a Takeda Fellowship, Yang will expand this promising work to develop an AI-based diagnosis model for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using sleep-breathing data that is significantly more reliable, flexible, and economical than current diagnostic tools. This passive, in-home, contactless monitoring system — resembling a simple home Wi-Fi router — will also enable remote disease assessment and continuous progression tracking. Yang’s groundbreaking work has the potential to advance the diagnosis and treatment of prevalent diseases like PD and AD, and it offers exciting possibilities for addressing many health challenges with reliable, affordable machine-learning tools.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proteins called transcription factors are like molecular traffic cops that tell genes when to stop and go. If they malfunction — what scientists refer to as dysregulation — transcription factors stop orchestrating healthy gene expression and instead become a driving force for diseases like cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, dysregulated transcription factors have garnered a lot of attention from researchers hoping to create new treatments for disease. But transcription factors have proven hard to drug, in part because they work in the context of various interdependent signaling molecules in the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MIT spinout Kronos Bio is studying those larger signaling networks to find new ways to disrupt transcription factor activity. By viewing transcription factors in their natural cellular context, the company believes it can develop more effective treatments to the many diseases that are driven by out-of-control transcription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key enabling technology for Kronos is a screening tool that allows scientists to study how transcription factors interact with other molecules. Kronos founder and MIT associate professor of biological engineering Angela Koehler has made important contributions to the tool over nearly two decades, and she continues to use it to study transcription factors in her lab today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Transcription factors never work in isolation,” Kronos Bio CEO Norbert Bischofberger says. “They work through multiple complex protein complexes. Angela spearheaded screening compounds in the cellular context they work in, and we’re building on that work.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kronos is already targeting the mother of all disease-associated transcription factors, known as MYC, in clinical trials. MYC is in every cell, but certain tumor cells overexpress MYC dramatically, relying on its constant transcription to drive cancer growth. Kronos is currently running a phase 1/2 study with patients who have relapsed or resistant MYC-dependent tumors, including patients with ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer. The company’s other drug in clinical trials targets a molecule associated with dysregulated transcription in acute myeloid leukemia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the trials are successful, Kronos believes its approach will allow it to develop treatments for a number of other cancers associated with transcription dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the Tumor Genome Atlas, roughly half of all tumors have amplified MYC, and if you look at triple negative breast and ovarian cancer, it’s 80 percent,” Bischofberger explains. “If you could find drugs that essentially reduce amplified MYC levels, you could take out a broad swath of human tumors for which MYC is a driver of the malignant phenotype. It’s a huge opportunity to improve patient lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From platform to product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koehler’s interest in transcription factors dates back to the early 2000s. As an investigator at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she is still a member, she was part of a group that developed a low-cost way to screen molecules for different binding properties. The approach could be used to find molecules that modulate transcription factors, and it garnered interest from pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What industry really liked was we didn’t need to purify a protein to run a screen,” Koehler explains. “We could come in with large protein complexes from cells, or potentially even patient cells, and look for our target of interest in a protein complex, which reflected a more native state to evaluate molecules.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Koehler started her lab at MIT, she used the approach to find molecules that bind to MYC. Many attempts to target MYC have failed over decades of drug development because it’s a difficult protein for molecules to latch on to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The problem is MYC is in this bucket of targets many call undruggable,” Koehler says. “It’s a transcription factor and it’s super floppy. It lacks shape and it’s highly disordered, so it’s difficult for molecules to find a binding pocket.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Koehler and her collaborators presented their early work on the MYC-binding molecule at a conference, sparking interest from investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The next two or three months, my office was like a revolving door for venture capitalists wanting to talk not just about the molecule, but to understand the platform we used to discover the molecule — that’s actually where there was more interest,” Koehler recalls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She started Kronos Bio later that year, working with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office to license the screening platform and a few specific molecules for the company. The Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation funded some of Koehler’s early work, and Koehler, who became faculty director of the center this summer, also says it helped connect her to investors and others in the biotech industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two members of Koehler’s lab became the first two employees of the company. Then Koehler met Bischofberger, who had spent 27 years as the head of research and development at Gilead Sciences and was looking to move into a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Kronos has taken a winding path to developing the final molecules currently being studied in its clinical trials. (That initial molecule she presented at the conference didn’t pan out.) Some of Kronos’ preclinical work was done in conjunction with the Broad Institute, where Koehler is an Institute Member. Koehler, who is also the associate director of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research and a founding member of the MIT Center for Precision Cancer Medicine, sits on the Kronos Bio scientific advisory board and says she’s following along with the company’s clinical progress like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What you’re looking for as a founder is the right group of people who you trust to make the right decisions,” Koehler says. “I’m a mom of four, and I often say it’s like you’re looking for the right college to send your kids to, but then you’ve got to step back and let them live their own life. That’s how I view it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drugging the undruggable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kronos Bio’s drug candidates are taken orally once a day, which allows patients to skip frequent trips to hospitals for IV infusions. In addition to targeting MYC-dependent tumors, Kronos’ drug is also being tested in humans to address other transcriptionally addicted cancers like sarcomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sarcomas are not widely mutated like other tumors; it’s often just a simple transcription factor fusion,” Bischofberger says. “The best example is Ewing’s sarcoma. That exists with two transcription factors fused together. Those are driven by aberrant transcription, and that’s something we’re excited to be going after.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company plans to present safety data from its trials by the end of this year, and by the middle of 2024 to present data showing whether its lead candidate can shrink MYC-dependent tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What you want to see is tumor shrinkage because none of these tumors shrink by themselves,” Bischofberger says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of those drug candidate’s success, Bischofberger believes Kronos is making important contributions to an understudied area of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are about 1,500 transcription factors, and about 200 of those are known to be involved in cancers, but very few have been drugged,” Bischofberger says. “The transcription factors that have been drugged have been widely successful — in multiple myeloma, for instance. This is a huge, open field to be working in.”&lt;/p&gt;
