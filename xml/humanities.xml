  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It’s not a stretch to suggest that when we disagree with other people, we often regard them as being irrational. Kevin Dorst PhD ’19 has developed a body of research with surprising things to say about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorst, an associate professor of philosophy at MIT, studies rationality: how we apply it, or think we do, and how that bears out in society. The goal is to help us think clearly and perhaps with fresh eyes about something we may take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his work, Dorst specializes in exploring the nuances of rationality. To take just one instance, consider how ambiguity can interact with rationality. Suppose there are two studies about the effect of a new housing subdivision on local traffic patterns: One shows there will be a substantial increase in traffic, and one shows a minor effect. Even if both studies are sound in their methods and data, neither may have a totally airtight case. People who regard themselves as rationally assessing the numbers will likely disagree about which is most valid, and — though this may not be entirely rational — may use their prior beliefs to poke holes in the study that does not represent their prior beliefs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other things, this process also calls into question the widespread “Bayesian” conception that people’s views shift and come into alignment as they’re presented with new evidence. It may be that instead, people apply rationality while their views diverge, not converge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the kind of phenomenon Dorst explores in the paper “Rational Polarization,” published in &lt;em&gt;The Philosophical Review&lt;/em&gt; in 2023; currently Dorst is working on a book about how people can take rational approaches but still wind up with different conclusions about the world. Dorst combines careful argumentation, mathematically structured descriptions of thinking, and even experimental evidence about cognition and people’s views, an increasing trend in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s something freeing about how methodologically open philosophy is,”&amp;nbsp;says Dorst, a good-humored and genial conversationalist. “A question can be philosophical if it’s important and we don’t yet have settled methods for answering it, because in philosophy it’s always okay to ask what methods we should be using. It’s one of the exciting things about philosophy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his research and teaching, Dorst was awarded tenure at MIT last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Show me your work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorst grew up in Missouri, not exactly expecting to become a philosopher, but he started following in the academic trail of his older brother, who had become interested in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t know what philosophy was growing up, but once my brother started getting interested, there was a little bootstrapping, egging each other on, and having someone to talk to,” Dorst says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis, Dorst majored in philosophy and political science. By graduation, he had become sold on studying philosophy full-time, and was accepted into MIT’s program as a doctoral student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Institute, he started specializing in the problems he now studies full-time, about how we know things and how much we are thinking rationally, while working with Roger White as his primary adviser, along with faculty members Robert Stalnaker and Kieran Setiya of MIT and Branden Fitelson of Northeastern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After earning his PhD, Dorst spent a year as a fellow at Oxford University’s Magdalen College, then joined faculty of the University of Pittsburgh. He returned to MIT, this time on the faculty, in 2022. Now settled in the MIT philosophy faculty, Dorst tries to continue the department’s tradition of engaged teaching with his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They wrestle like everyone does with the conceptual and philosophical questions, but the speed with which you can get through technical things in a course is astounding,” Dorst says of MIT undergraduates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New methods, time-honored issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present Dorst, who has published widely in philosophy journals, is grinding through the process of writing a book manuscript about the complexity of rationality. Chapter subjects include hindsight bias, confirmation bias, overconfidence, and polarization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process, Dorst is also developing and conducting more experiments than ever before, to look at the way people process information and regard themselves as being rational.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s this whole movement of experimental philosophy, using experimental data, being sensitive to cognitive science and being interested in connecting questions we have to it,” Dorst says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his case, he adds, “The big picture is trying to connect the theoretical work on rationality with the more empirical work about what leads to polarization,” he says. The salience of the work, meanwhile, applies to a wide range of subjects:&amp;nbsp; “People have been polarized forever over everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he explains all of this, Dorst looks up at the whiteboard in his office, where an extensive set of equations represents the output of some experiments and his ongoing effort to comprehend the results, as part of the book project. When he finishes, he hopes to have work broadly useful in philosophy, cognitive science, and other fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We might use some different models in philosophy,” he says, “but let’s all try to figure out how people process information and regard arguments.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Letterlocking: A new look at a centuries-old practice</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For as long as people have been communicating through writing, they have found ways to keep their messages private. Before the invention of the gummed envelope in 1830, securing correspondence involved letterlocking, an ingenious process of folding a flat sheet of paper to become its own envelope, often using a combination of folds, tucks, slits, or adhesives such as sealing wax. Letter writers from Erasmus to Catherine de’ Medici to Emily Dickinson employed these techniques, which Jana Dambrogio, the MIT Libraries’ Thomas F. Peterson (1957) Conservator, has named “letterlocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The study of letterlocking very consciously bridges humanities and sciences,” says Dambrogio, who first became interested in the practice as a fellow in the conservation studio of the Vatican Apostolic Archives, where she discovered examples from the 15th and 16th centuries. “It draws on the perspectives of not only conservators and historians, but also engineers, imaging experts, and scientists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now the rich history of this centuries-old document security technology is the subject of a new book,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049276/letterlocking/"&gt;Letterlocking: The Hidden History of the Letter&lt;/a&gt;,” published by the MIT Press and co-authored with Daniel Starza Smith, a lecturer in early modern English literature at King’s College London. Dambrogio and Smith have pioneered the field of letterlocking research over the last 10 years, working with an international and interdisciplinary collection of experts, the Unlocking History Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With more than 300 images and diagrams, “Letterlocking” explores the practice’s history through real examples from all over the world. It includes a dictionary of 60 technical terms and concepts, systems the authors developed while studying more than 250,000 historic letters. The book aims to be a springboard for new discoveries, whether providing a new lens on history or spurring technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In working with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/mit-libraries-explore-17th-century-postal-archive-signed-sealed-undelivered-1110"&gt;Brienne Collection&lt;/a&gt; — a 17th-century postal trunk full of undelivered letters — the Unlocking History Research Group sought to study intact examples of locked letters without destroying them in the process. This stimulated advances in conservation, radiology, and computational algorithms. In 2020, the team collaborated with researchers from the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Amanda Ghassaei SM ’17, and Holly Jackson ’22, to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/researchers-virtually-open-sealed-historic-letters-0302"&gt;develop new algorithms&lt;/a&gt; that could virtually read an unopened letter, publishing the results in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Letterlocking” also offers a comprehensive guide to making one’s own locked letters. “The best introduction to letterlocking is to make some models,” says Dambrogio. “Feel the shape and the weight; see how easy it would be to conceal or hard to open without being noticed. We’re inviting people to explore and expand this new field of study through ‘mind and hand.’”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 2025&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/by-subject"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; World University Ranking&lt;/a&gt; has ranked MIT first in three subject categories: Arts and Humanities, Business and Economics, and Social Sciences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Times Higher Education World University Ranking is an annual publication of university rankings by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt;, a leading British education magazine. The subject rankings are based on 18 rigorous performance indicators. Criteria include teaching, research environment, research volume and influence, industry, and international outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Disciplines included in the 2025 top-ranked subjects are housed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS), the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sap.mit.edu/"&gt;School of Architecture and Planning&lt;/a&gt; (SA+P), and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/"&gt;MIT Sloan School of Management&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The rankings are a testament to the extraordinary quality of the research and teaching that takes place in SHASS and across MIT,” says&amp;nbsp;Agustín Rayo, Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS and professor of philosophy. “There has never been a more important time to ensure that we train students who understand the social, economic, political, and human aspects of the great challenges of our time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/arts-and-humanities?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rankings-monthly&amp;amp;spMailingID=30555835&amp;amp;spUserID=MTAxNzcwODg4NjA4NwS2&amp;amp;spJobID=2631481430&amp;amp;spReportId=MjYzMTQ4MTQzMAS2"&gt;Arts and Humanities ranking&lt;/a&gt; evaluated 750 universities from 72 countries in the disciplines of languages, literature, and linguistics; history, philosophy, and theology; architecture; archaeology; and art, performing arts, and design. This marks the first time MIT has earned the top spot in this subject since &lt;em&gt;Times Higher Education&lt;/em&gt; began publishing rankings in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The ranking for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/business-and-economics?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rankings-monthly&amp;amp;spMailingID=30555835&amp;amp;spUserID=MTAxNzcwODg4NjA4NwS2&amp;amp;spJobID=2631481430&amp;amp;spReportId=MjYzMTQ4MTQzMAS2"&gt;Business and Economics&lt;/a&gt; evaluated 990 institutions from 85 countries and territories across three core disciplines: business and management; accounting and finance; and, economics and econometrics. This is the fourth consecutive year MIT has been ranked first in this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/social-sciences?utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=rankings-monthly&amp;amp;spMailingID=30555835&amp;amp;spUserID=MTAxNzcwODg4NjA4NwS2&amp;amp;spJobID=2631481430&amp;amp;spReportId=MjYzMTQ4MTQzMAS2"&gt;Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; ranking evaluated 1,093 institutions from 100 countries and territories in the disciplines of political science and international studies; sociology, geography, communication and media studies; and anthropology. The areas under evaluation include political science and international relations; sociology; geography; communication and media studies; and anthropology. MIT claimed the top spot alone in this subject, after tying for first in 2024 with Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other subjects, MIT was also named among the top universities, ranking third in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/computer-science"&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/engineering"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/life-sciences"&gt;Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, and fourth in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2025/subject-ranking/physical-sciences"&gt;Physical Sciences&lt;/a&gt;.

  <title>An “All-American” vision of service to others</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Former NFL linebacker Spencer Paysinger keynotes the 51st annual MLK Celebration, with a message focused on building community.]]></description>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spencer Paysinger has already been many things in his life, including a Super Bowl-winning linebacker, a writer and producer of the hit television series “All-American,” and local-business entrepreneur. But as he explained during his keynote speech at MIT’s 51st annual event celebrating the life and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., Paysinger would prefer to think about his journey in additional terms: whether he has been able to serve others along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I stand up here today talking about Dr. King’s mission, Dr. King’s dream, why we’re all here today, to me it all leans back into community,” Paysinger said. “I want to be judged by what I have done for others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to reach out to others, in good times and bad, was a theme of the annual event, which took place in MIT’s Walker Memorial (Building 50), on Thursday. As Paysinger noted, his own career is marked by being a “team player” and finding reward in shared endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, I’m at my best when I have people on the right and on the left of me attempting to reach the same dream,” Paysinger said. “We can have different ideologies, we can come from different backgrounds, of race, socioeconomic backgrounds. … At the end of the day it comes back to the mindset we need to have. It’s rooted in community, it’s rooted in togetherness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event featured an array of talks delivered by students, campus leaders, and guests, along with musical interludes, and drew hundreds from the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In opening remarks, MIT President Sally A. Kornbluth praised Paysinger, saying his “perseverance and tenacity are a fantastic example to us all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kornbluth also spoke about the values, and value, of MIT itself. American universities and colleges, she noted, have long “been a point of national pride and a source of international envy. … They and we have always been valued as centers of excellence creativity, innovation, and an infinitely renewable source of leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, Kornbluth noted, the MIT community will continue to pursue excellence and provide mutual respect for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is in the talent business,” Kornbluth said. “Our success, and living up to our great mission, depends on our ability to attract extraordinarily talented people and to create a community in which everyone earns a place here to do their very best work. … Everyone at MIT is here because they deserve to be here. Every staff member, every faculty member, every postdoc, every student, every one of us. Every one of us is a full member of this community, and every member of our community is valued as a human being, and valued for what they contribute to our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paysinger lauded the array of speakers as well as the friendly atmosphere at the event, where attendees sat around luncheon tables, talking and getting to know each other before and after the slate of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You guys actively and literally in 45 minutes have changed my view of what MIT is,” Paysinger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his NFL career, Paysinger was a linebacker who played with the New York Giants, Miami Dolphins, and Carolina Panthers, from 2011 through 2017, appearing in 94 regular-season games and five playoff games. He saw action in Super Bowl XLVI, when the Giants beat the New England Patriots, 22-17, something he joked about a few times for his Massachusetts audience. Paysinger’s former New York Giants teammate, fellow linebacker Mark Herzlich, was also in attendance on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paysinger grew up in South Central Los Angeles, long perceived from the outside as a place of danger and deprivation. And while he experienced those things, Paysinger said, his home neighborhood also had its “all-American” side, as kids raced bikes down the block and grew to know each other. Paysinger attended Beverly Hills High School, starring as a wide receiver, then signed with the University of Oregon, where he converted to linebacker. Oregon and Paysinger reached college football’s national championship game in his senior season, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his talk, Paysinger emphasized the twists and turns of his journey through football, from changing positions on the field to changing teams. He noted that, in sports as in life, moving beyond our comfort zone can help us thrive in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was scared, I wasn’t sure of myself, when my coaches decided to make that change for me,” Paysinger said. However, he added, “I knew that [from] leaning into the uncomfortableness of the moment, the other side could be greater for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL soon beckoned, along with a Super Bowl ring. But Paysinger received a jolt beyond the boundaries of sports in 2015, when his former Giants teammate and close friend Tyler Sash died suddently at age 27. Among other things, Paysinger began thinking about life after football more systematically and began his screenwriting efforts in earnest, even as his football career was still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All-American,” now entering its 7th season on the CW Network, is loosely based on his own background, capturing the dynamics of his experiences as a player and team member. It has become one of the longest-running sports-based shows on television. Paysinger is also an entrepreneur who founded Hilltop Kitchen and Coffee, a chain of eateries in underserved areas around Los Angeles, and has helped develop other local businesses as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while every new venture is a fresh challenge, Paysinger said, we can often accomplish more than we realize: “I’m not coming from a mindset of deciding whether I can or can’t do something, but if I want to or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore Michael Ewing provided welcoming remarks and introduced Paysinger. He read aloud a quote from King chosen as a central motif of this year’s celebration: “We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his own part, Ewing said, “When I read these words, I think of a society that aspires to improve its circumstances, address existing issues, and create a more positive and just environment for all.” At MIT, Ewing added, there is “a community where students, professors, and others come together to achieve at the highest levels, united by a shared desire to learn and grow. … The process of collaborating, disagreeing, building with others who are different — this is the key to growth and development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The annual MLK Celebration featured further reflections from students, including second-year undergraduate Siddhu Pachipala, a political science and economics double-major. Pachipala began his remarks by recounting a social media exchange he once had with a congressional account, the tenor of which he soon regretted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking back, I think it was a missed opportunity,” Pachipala said. “Why was my first instinct … to turn it into a battle? … We train ourselves to believe that if we’re not scoring hits, we’re losing, and gestures of decency are traps, that an extended hand must be slapped away. Martin Luther King Jr. took politics to be something more substantial. He had a serious vision of justice, one we’ve gathered today to honor. But he knew that justice had a prerequisite: friendship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elshareef Kabbashi, a graduate student in architecture, offered additional remarks, noting that “Dr. King’s dream was never confined to a single movement, nation, or moment in history,” but rather aimed at creating “human dignity everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E. Denise Simmons, mayor of the City of Cambridge, also spoke, and lauded “the entire MIT community for keeping this tradition alive for 51 years.” She added: “It’s Dr. King’s wisdom, his courage, his moral clarity, that helped light the path forward. And I ask each of you to continue to shine that light.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The luncheon included the presentation of the annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership Awards Recipients, given this year to Cordelia Price ’78, SM ’80; Pouya Alimagham; Ciarra Ortiz; Sahal Ahmed; William Gibbs; and Maxine Samuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a day full of thoughts about King and his vision, Paysinger underscored the salience of community by highlighting another of his favorite King passages: “Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. This is the judgment. Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT senior Markey Freudenburg-Puricelli and alumnae Abigail (“Abbie”) Schipper ’24 and Rachel Zhang ’21 have been selected as Gates Cambridge Scholars and will begin graduate studies this fall in the field of their choice at Cambridge University in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now celebrating its 25th year, the Gates Cambridge program provides fully funded post-graduate scholarships to outstanding applicants from countries outside of the U.K. The mission of Gates Cambridge is to build a global network of future leaders committed to changing the world for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students interested in applying to Gates Cambridge should contact Kim Benard, associate dean of distinguished fellowships in Career Advising and Professional Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markey Freudenburg-Puricelli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freudenburg-Puricelli is majoring in Earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences and minoring in Spanish. Her passion for geoscience has led her to travel to different corners of the world to conduct geologic fieldwork. These experiences have motivated her to pursue a career in developing scientific policy and environmental regulation that can protect those most vulnerable to climate change. As a Gates Cambridge Scholar, she will pursue an MPhil in environmental policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving at MIT, Freudenburg-Puricelli joined the Terrascope first-year learning community, which&amp;nbsp;focuses on hands-on education relating to global environmental issues. She then became an undergraduate research assistant in the McGee Lab for Paleoclimate and Geochronology, where she gathered and interpreted data used to understand climate features of permafrost across northern Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a summer internship in Chile researching volcanoes at the Universidad Católica del Norte, Freudenburg-Puricelli joined the Gehring Lab for Plant Genetics, Epigenetics, and Seed Biology. Last summer, she traveled to Peru to work with the Department of Paleontology at the Universidad Nacional de Piura, conducting fieldwork and preserving and organizing fossil specimens. Freudenburg-Puricelli has also done fieldwork on sedimentology in New Mexico, geological mapping in the Mojave Desert, and field oceanography onboard the SSV Corwith Cramer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On campus, Freudenburg-Puricelli is an avid glassblower and has been a teaching assistant at the MIT glassblowing lab. She is also a tour guide for the MIT Office of Admissions and has volunteered with the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences’ first-year pre-orientation program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abigail “Abbie” Schipper ’24&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally from Portland, Oregon, Schipper graduated from MIT with a BS in mechanical engineering and a minor in biology. At Cambridge, she will pursue an MPhil in engineering, researching medical devices used in pre-hospital trauma systems in low- and middle-income countries with the Cambridge Health Systems Design group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At MIT, Schipper was a member of MIT Emergency Medical Services, volunteering on the ambulance and serving as the heartsafe officer and director of ambulance operations. Inspired by her work in CPR education, she helped create the LifeSaveHer project, which aims to decrease the gender disparity in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival outcomes through the creation of female CPR mannequins and associated research. This team was the first-place winner of the 2023 PKG IDEAS Competition and a recipient of the Eloranta Research Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schipper’s work has also focused on designing medical devices for low-resource or extreme environments. As an undergraduate, she performed research in the lab of Professor Giovanni Traverso, where she worked on a project designing a drug delivery implant for regions with limited access to surgery. During a summer internship at the University College London Collaborative Center for Inclusion Health, she worked with the U.K.’s National Health Service to create durable, low-cost carbon dioxide sensors to approximate the risk of airborne infectious disease transmission in shelters for people experiencing homelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduation, Schipper interned at SAGA Space Architecture through MISTI Denmark, designing life support systems for an underwater habitat that will be used for astronaut training and oceanographic research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schipper was a member of the Concourse learning community, Sigma Kappa Sorority, and her living group, Burton 3rd. In her free time, she enjoys fixing bicycles and playing the piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rachel Zhang ’21&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhang graduated from MIT with a BS in physics in 2021. During her senior year, she was a recipient of the Joel Matthews Orloff Award. She then earned an MS in astronomy at Northwestern University. An internship at the Center for Computational Astrophysics at the Flatiron Institute deepened her interest in the applications of machine learning for astronomy. At Cambridge, she will pursue a PhD in applied mathematics and theoretical physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A new initiative will offer faculty in the MIT &lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences&lt;/a&gt; (SHASS) the opportunity to participate in a semester-long internal fellows program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The SHASS Faculty Fellows program, administered by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/human-insight-collaborative/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Human Insight Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; (MITHIC), will provide faculty with time to focus on their research, writing, or artistic production, and to receive collegial support for the same; to foster social and intellectual community within SHASS, including between faculty and students beyond the classroom; and provide informal opportunities to develop intergenerational professional mentorships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“SHASS faculty have been eager for a supportive, vibrant internal community for the nearly 35 years I’ve been at MIT,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://history.mit.edu/people/anne-e-c-mccants/" target="_blank"&gt;Anne McCants&lt;/a&gt;, the Ann F. Friedlaender Professor of History, and Faculty Fellows Program committee chair. “By providing participants with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://urop.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;UROPs&lt;/a&gt; [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program projects] and other opportunities to interact with students, we’re demonstrating our commitment to fostering an environment in which faculty can recharge and sustain the high-quality teaching and service our community has come to expect and appreciate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The creation of the program was one of the recommendations included in a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://shass.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SHASS_Programming_Initiative_Report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;May 2024 SHASS Programming Initiative Report&lt;/a&gt;, an effort led by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/keeril-makan" target="_blank"&gt;Keeril Makan&lt;/a&gt;, SHASS associate dean for strategic initiatives, and the Michael (1949) and Sonja Koerner Music Composition Professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The inaugural group of fellows for Spring 2026 includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/hector-beltran" target="_blank"&gt;Héctor Beltrán&lt;/a&gt;, Class of 1957 Career Development Associate Professor, MIT Anthropology&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/volha-charnysh" target="_blank"&gt;Volha Charnysh&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;Ford Career Development Associate Professor, Department of Political Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/people/faculty/dorst/" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Dorst&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor, MIT Philosophy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/richard-nielsen" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Nielsen&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor, Department of Political Science&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/emily-richmond-pollock" target="_blank"&gt;Emily Richmond Pollock&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor, MIT Music&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/jessica-ruffin/" target="_blank"&gt;Jessica Ruffin&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor, MIT Literature&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/robin-scheffler/" target="_blank"&gt;Robin Scheffler&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor, Program in Science, Technology, and Society&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Tenure-line faculty are eligible to apply, with a maximum of 12 members selected per year, or roughly six participants per term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Selected&amp;nbsp;faculty will spend a semester outside the classroom while still holding time for sustained interaction with a small cohort of colleagues. Fellows can work with the dedicated students in UROP&amp;nbsp;to advance&amp;nbsp;their research projects while investing in a unique, cross-disciplinary set of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I was honored to help design the Fellows Program and to serve on the review committee,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://lit.mit.edu/abahr/"&gt;Arthur Bahr&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Literature Section and a member of the Faculty Fellows Program Selection Committee. “I was fortunate to have wonderful mentors within Literature, but would have loved the opportunity to get to know and learn from colleagues in other fields, which the Fellows Program will offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“What excites me about the Faculty Fellows Program — beyond the opportunity for faculty to connect with each other across disciplines and units — is that it will spotlight the excellence and centrality of the humanities, arts, and social sciences at MIT,” says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/heather-paxson" target="_blank"&gt;Heather Paxson&lt;/a&gt;, SHASS associate dean for faculty, and the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor of Anthropology. “I look forward to hearing about new ideas sparked, and new friendships made, through participation in the program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Organizers say the program signals that MIT takes its investment in the humanities, arts and social sciences as seriously as its peer institutions, most of which have internal fellows programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given the strong demand for something like this, getting the program up and running is an important signal to SHASS faculty that Dean [Agustín] Rayo hears their concerns and is committed to supporting this type of community development,” McCants notes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Inside MIT’s Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center, on the springy blue mat of the gymnastics room, an unconventional anatomy lesson unfolded during an October meeting of class STS.024/CMS.524 (&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/thinking-on-your-feet/"&gt;Thinking on Your Feet: Dance as a Learning Science&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Supported by a grant from the &lt;a href="http://arts.mit.edu/cast"&gt;MIT Center for Art, Science &amp;amp; Technology&lt;/a&gt; (CAST), Thinking on Your Feet was developed and offered for the first time in Fall 2024 by &lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/jennifer-s-light/"&gt;Jennifer S. Light&lt;/a&gt;, the Bern Dibner Professor of the History of Science and Technology and a professor of Urban Studies and Planning. Light’s vision for the class included a varied lineup of guest instructors. During the last week of October, she handed the reins to Middlebury College Professor Emerita Andrea Olsen, whose expertise bridges dance and science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Olsen organized the class into small groups. Placing hands on each other’s shoulders conga-line style, participants shuffled across the mat personifying the layers of the nervous system as Olsen had just explained them: the supportive spinal cord and bossy brain of the central nervous system; the sympathetic nervous system responsible for fight-or-flight and its laid-back parasympathetic counterpart; and the literal “gut feelings” of the enteric nervous system. The groups giggled and stumbled as they attempted to stay in character and coordinate their movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Unusual as this exercise was, it perfectly suited a class dedicated to movement as a tool for teaching and learning. One of the class’s introductory readings, an excerpt from Annie Murphy Paul’s book “The Extended Mind,” suggests why this was a more effective primer on the nervous system than a standard lecture: “Our memory for what we have&amp;nbsp;heard is remarkably weak. Our memory for what we have&amp;nbsp;done, however — for physical actions we have undertaken — is much more robust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Head-to-toe education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thinking on Your Feet is the third course spun out from Light’s Project on Embodied Education (the other two, developed in collaboration with MIT Director of Physical Education and Wellness Carrie Sampson Moore, examine the history of exercise in relation to schools and medicine, respectively). A historian of science and technology and historian of education for much of her career, Light refocused her scholarship on movement and learning after she’d begun training at Somerville’s Esh Circus Arts to counteract the stress of serving as department head. During her sabbatical a few years later, as part of Esh’s pre-professional program for aspiring acrobats, she took a series of dance classes spanning genres from ballet to hip-hop to Afro modern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I started playing with the idea that this is experiential learning — could I bring something like this back to MIT?” she recalls. “There’s a ton of interesting contemporary scientific research on cognition and learning as not just neck-up processes, but whole-body processes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Thinking on Your Feet provides an overview of recent scientific studies indicating the surprising extent to which physical activity enhances attention, memory, executive function, and other aspects of mental acuity. Other readings consider dance’s role in the transmission of knowledge throughout human history — from the Native Hawaiian tradition of hula to early forms of ballet in European courts — and describe the ways movement-based instruction can engage underserved populations and neurodiverse learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“You can argue for embodied learning on so many dimensions,” says Light. “I want my students to understand that what they’ve been taught about learning is only part of the story, and that contemporary science, ancient wisdom, and non-Western traditions all have a lot to tell us about how we might rethink education to maximize the benefits for all different kinds of students.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;If you scan the new class’s syllabus, you’re unlikely to miss the word “fun.” It appears twice — bolded, in all caps, and garnished by an exclamation point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I’m trying to bring a playful, experimental, ‘you don’t have to be perfect, just be creative’ vibe,” says Light. A dance background is not a prerequisite. The 18 students who registered this fall ranged from experienced dancers to novices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I initially took this class just to fulfill my arts requirement,” admits junior physics major Matson Garza, one of the latter group. He was surprised at how much he enjoyed it. “I have an interest in physics education, and I’ve found that beyond introductory courses it’s often lacking intuition. Integrating movement may be one way to solve this problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Similarly, second-year biological engineering major Annabel Tiong found her entry point through an interest in hands-on education, deepened after volunteering with a program that aims to spark curiosity about health-care careers by engaging kids in medical simulations. “While I don’t have an extensive background in dance,” she says, “I was curious how dance, with its free-form and creative nature, could be used to teach STEM topics that appear to be quite concrete and technical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;To build on each Tuesday’s lectures and discussions, Thursday “lab” sessions focused on overcoming inhibitions, teaching different styles of movement, and connecting dance with academic content. McKersin of Lakaï Arts, a lecturer in dance for the MIT Music and Theater Arts section, led a lab on Haitian harvest dances; Guy Steele PhD ’80 and Clark Baker SM ’80 of the MIT Tech Squares club provided an intro to square dancing and some of its connections to math and programming. Light invited some of her own dance instructors from the circus community, including Johnny Blazes, who specializes (according to their website) in working with “people who have been told implicitly and explicitly that they don’t belong in movement and fitness spaces.” Another, Reba Rosenberg, led the students through basic partner acrobatics that Light says did wonders for the class’s sense of confidence and community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Afterwards, several students asked, ‘Could we do this again?’” remembers Light. “None of them thought they could do the thing that by the end of class they were able to do: balance on each other, stand on each other. You can imagine how the need to physically trust someone with your safety yields incredible benefits when we’re back in the classroom.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancing to learn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The culmination of Thinking on Your Feet — a final project constituting 40 percent of students’ grades — required each student to create a dance-based lesson plan on a STEM topic of their choice. Students were exposed throughout the semester to examples of such pedagogy. Olsen’s nervous-system parade was one. Others came courtesy of Lewis Hou of Science Ceilidh, an organization that uses Scottish highland dance to illustrate concepts across the natural and physical sciences, and MIT alumna Yamilée Toussaint ’08, whose nonprofit STEM from Dance helps young women of color create performances with technical components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As a stepping stone, Light had planned a midterm assignment asking students to adapt existing choreography. But her students surprised her by wanting to jump directly into creating their own dances from scratch. Those first forays weren’t elaborate, but Light was impressed enough by their efforts that she plans to amend the syllabus accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“One group was doing differential calculus and imagining the floor as a graph,” she recalls, “having dancers think about where they were in relation to each other.” Another group, comprising members of the MIT Ballroom Dance team, choreographed the computer science concept of pipelined processors. “They were giving commands to each other like ‘load’ and ‘execute’ and ‘write back,’” Light says. “The beauty of this is that the students could offer each other feedback on the technical piece of it. Like, ‘OK, I see that you’re trying to explain a clock cycle. Maybe try to do it this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Among the pipelined processing team was senior Kateryna Morhun, a competitive ballroom dancer since age 4 who is earning her degree in artificial intelligence and decision-making. “We wanted to challenge ourselves to teach a specialized, more technical topic that isn’t usually a target of embodied learning initiatives,” Morhun says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;How useful can dance really be in teaching advanced academic content? This was a lively topic of debate among the Thinking on Your Feet cohort. It’s a question Light intends to investigate further with mechanical engineering lecturer Benita Comeau, who audited the class and offered a lab exploring the connections among dance, physics, and martial arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“This class sparked many ideas for me, across multiple subject matters and movement styles,” says Comeau. “As an example, the square dance class reminded me of the symmetry groups that are used to describe molecular symmetry in chemistry, and it occurred to me that students could move through symmetry groups and learn about chirality” — a geometric property relevant to numerous branches of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For their final presentation, Garza and Tiong’s group tackled substitution mechanisms, a topic from organic chemistry (“notoriously viewed as a very difficult and dreaded class,” according to their write-up). Their lesson plan specified that learners would first need to familiarize themselves with key points through conventional readings and discussion. But then, to bring that material alive, groups of learners representing atoms would take the floor. One, portraying a central carbon atom, would hold out an arm indicating readiness to accept an electron. Another would stand to the side with two balls representing electrons, bonded by a ribbon. Others would rotate in a predetermined order around the central carbon to portray a model’s initial stereochemistry. And so a dance would begin: a three-dimensional, human-scale visualization of a complex chemical process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The group was asked to summarize what they hoped learners would discover through their dance. “Chemistry is very dynamic!” they wrote. “It’s not mixing chemicals to magically make new ones — it’s a dynamic process of collision, bonding, and molecule-breaking that causes some structures to vanish and others to appear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to evaluating the impact of movement in her classes in collaboration with Raechel Soicher from the MIT Teaching + Learning Lab, Light is working on a book about how modern science has rediscovered the ancient wisdom of embodied learning. She hopes her class will kick off a conversation at MIT about incorporating such movement-assisted insights into the educational practices of the future. In fact, she believes MIT’s heritage of innovative pedagogy makes it ripe for these explorations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;As her syllabus puts it: “For all of us, as part of the MIT community, this class invites us to reconsider how our ‘mind and hand’ approach to experiential learning — a product of the 19th century — might be expanded to ‘mind and body’ for the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;During a meeting of class 6.C40/24.C40 (Ethics of Computing), Professor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/"&gt;Armando Solar-Lezama&lt;/a&gt; poses the same impossible question to his students that he often asks himself in the research he leads with the Computer Assisted Programming Group at MIT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"How do we make sure that a machine does what we want, and only what we want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At this moment, what some consider the golden age of generative AI, this may seem like an urgent new question. But Solar-Lezama, the Distinguished Professor of Computing at MIT, is quick to point out that this struggle is as old as humankind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;He begins to retell the Greek myth of King Midas, the monarch who was granted the godlike power to transform anything he touched into solid gold. Predictably, the wish backfired when Midas accidentally turned everyone he loved into gilded stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Be careful what you ask for because it might be granted in ways you don't expect," he says, cautioning his students, many of them aspiring mathematicians and programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Digging into MIT archives to share slides of grainy black-and-white photographs, he narrates the history of programming. We hear about the 1970s Pygmalion machine that required incredibly detailed cues, to the late '90s computer software that took teams of engineers years and an 800-page document to program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While remarkable in their time, these processes took too long to reach users. They left no room for spontaneous discovery, play, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Solar-Lezama talks about the risks of building modern machines that don't always respect a programmer's cues or red lines, and that are equally capable of exacting harm as saving lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Titus Roesler, a senior majoring in electrical engineering, nods knowingly. Roesler is writing his final paper on the ethics of autonomous vehicles and weighing who is morally responsible when one hypothetically hits and kills a pedestrian. His argument questions underlying assumptions behind technical advances, and considers multiple valid viewpoints. It leans on the philosophy theory of utilitarianism. Roesler explains, "Roughly, according to utilitarianism, the moral thing to do brings about the most good for the greatest number of people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT philosopher&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/"&gt;Brad Skow&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Solar-Lezama developed and is team-teaching the course, leans forward and takes notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A class that demands technical and philosophical expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Ethics of Computing, offered for the first time in Fall 2024, was created through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/common-ground-for-computing-education/"&gt;Common Ground for Computing Education&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing that brings multiple departments together to develop and teach new courses and launch new programs that blend computing with other disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The instructors alternate lecture days. Skow, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Professor of Philosophy, brings his discipline's lens for examining the broader implications of today's ethical issues, while Solar-Lezama, who is also the associate director and chief operating officer of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, offers perspective through his.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Skow and Solar-Lezama attend one another's lectures and adjust their follow-up class sessions in response. Introducing the element of learning from one another in real time has made for more dynamic and responsive class conversations. A recitation to break down the week's topic with graduate students from philosophy or computer science and a lively discussion combine the course content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"An outsider might think that this is going to be a class that will make sure that these new computer programmers being sent into the world by MIT always do the right thing," Skow says. However, the class is intentionally designed to teach students a different skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Determined to create an impactful semester-long course that did more than lecture students about right or wrong, philosophy professor Caspar Hare conceived the idea for Ethics of Computing in his role as an associate dean of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt;. Hare recruited Skow and Solar-Lezama as the lead instructors, as he knew they could do something more profound than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Thinking deeply about the questions that come up in this class requires both technical and philosophical expertise. There aren't other classes at MIT that place both side-by-side,” Skow says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;That's exactly what drew senior Alek Westover to enroll. The math and computer science double major explains, "A lot of people are talking about how the trajectory of AI will look in five years. I thought it was important to take a class that will help me think more about that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Westover says he's drawn to philosophy because of an interest in ethics and a desire to distinguish right from wrong. In math classes, he's learned to write down a problem statement and receive instant clarity on whether he's successfully solved it or not. However, in Ethics of Computing, he has learned how to make written arguments for "tricky philosophical questions" that may not have a single correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;For example, "One problem we could be concerned about is, what happens if we build powerful AI agents that can do any job a human can do?" Westover asks. "If we are interacting with these AIs to that degree, should we be paying them a salary? How much should we care about what they want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;There's no easy answer, and Westover assumes he'll encounter many other dilemmas in the workplace in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“So, is the internet destroying the world?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The semester began with a deep dive into AI risk, or the notion of "whether AI poses an existential risk to humanity," unpacking free will, the science of how our brains make decisions under uncertainty, and debates about the long-term liabilities, and regulation of AI. A second, longer unit zeroed in on "the internet, the World Wide Web, and the social impact of technical decisions." The end of the term looks at privacy, bias, and free speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;One class topic was devoted to provocatively asking: "So, is the internet destroying the world?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Senior Caitlin Ogoe is majoring in Course 6-9 (Computation and Cognition). Being in an environment where she can examine these types of issues is precisely why the self-described "technology skeptic" enrolled in the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Growing up with a mom who is hearing impaired and a little sister with a developmental disability, Ogoe became the default family member whose role it was to call providers for tech support or program iPhones. She leveraged her skills into a part-time job fixing cell phones, which paved the way for her to develop a deep interest in computation, and a path to MIT. However, a prestigious summer fellowship in her first year made her question the ethics behind how consumers were impacted by the technology she was helping to program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Everything I've done with technology is from the perspective of people, education, and personal connection," Ogoe says. "This is a niche that I love. Taking humanities classes around public policy, technology, and culture is one of my big passions, but this is the first course I've taken that also involves a philosophy professor."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The following week, Skow lectures on the role of bias in AI, and Ogoe, who is entering the workforce next year, but plans to eventually attend law school to focus on regulating related issues, raises her hand to ask questions or share counterpoints four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Skow digs into examining COMPAS, a controversial AI software that uses an algorithm to predict the likelihood that people accused of crimes would go on to re-offend. According to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm"&gt;2018 ProPublica article&lt;/a&gt;, COMPAS was likely to flag Black defendants as future criminals and gave false positives at twice the rate as it did to white defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The class session is dedicated to determining whether the article warrants the conclusion that the COMPAS system is biased and should be discontinued. To do so, Skow introduces two different theories on fairness:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Substantive fairness is the idea that a particular outcome might be fair or unfair," he explains. "Procedural fairness is about whether the procedure by which an outcome is produced is fair." A variety of conflicting criteria of fairness are then introduced, and the class discusses which were plausible, and what conclusions they warranted about the COMPAS system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Later on, the two professors go upstairs to Solar-Lezama's office to debrief on how the exercise had gone that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;"Who knows?" says Solar-Lezama. "Maybe five years from now, everybody will laugh at how people were worried about the existential risk of AI. But one of the themes I see running through this class is learning to approach these debates beyond media discourse and getting to the bottom of thinking rigorously about these issues."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the story goes, the Scottish inventor James Watt envisioned how steam engines should work on one day in 1765, when he was walking across Glasgow Green, a park in his hometown. Watt realized that putting a separate condenser in an engine would allow its main cylinder to remain hot, making the engine more efficient and compact than the huge steam engines then in existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet Watt, who had been pondering the problem for a while, needed a partnership with entrepreneur Matthew Boulton to get a practical product to market, starting in 1775 and becoming successful in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People still use this story of Watt’s ‘Eureka!’ moment, which Watt himself promoted later in his life,” says MIT Professor David Mindell, an engineer and historian of science and engineering. “But it took 20 years of hard labor, during which Watt struggled to support a family and had multiple failures, to get it out in the world. Multiple other inventions were required to achieve what we today call product-market fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full story of the steam engine, Mindell argues, is a classic case of what is today called “process innovation,” not just “product innovation.” Inventions are rarely fully-formed products, ready to change the world. Mostly, they need a constellation of improvements, and sustained persuasion, to become adopted into industrial systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was true for Watt still holds, as Mindell’s body of work shows. Most technology-driven growth today comes from overlapping advances, when inventors and companies tweak and improve things over time. Now, Mindell explores those ideas in a forthcoming book, “&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049528/the-new-lunar-society/" target="_blank"&gt;The New Lunar Society: An Enlightenment Guide to the Next Industrial Revolution&lt;/a&gt;,” being published on Feb. 24 by the MIT Press.&amp;nbsp;Mindell is professor of aeronautics and astronautics and the Dibner Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing at MIT, where he has also co-founded the Work of the Future initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve overemphasized product innovation, although we’re very good at it,” Mindell says. “But it’s become apparent that process innovation is just as important: how you improve the making, fixing, rebuilding, or upgrading of systems. These are deeply entangled. Manufacturing is part of process innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, with so many things being positioned as world-changing products, it may be especially important to notice that being adaptive and persistent is practically the essence of improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Young innovators don’t always realize that when their invention doesn’t work at first, they’re at the start of a process where they have to refine and engage, and find the right partners to grow,” Mindell says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manufacturing at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title of Mindell’s book refers to British Enlightenment thinkers and inventors — Watt was one of them — who used to meet in a group they called the Lunar Society, centered in Birmingham. This included pottery innovator Josiah Wedgewood; physician Erasmus Darwin; chemist Joseph Priestley; and Boulton, a metal manufacturer whose work and capital helped make Watt’s improved steam engine a reliable product. The book moves between chapters on the old Lunar Society and those on contemporary industrial systems, drawing parallels between then and now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The stories about the Lunar Society are models for the way people can go about their careers, engineering or otherwise, in a way they may not see in popular press about technology today,” Mindell says. “Everyone told Wedgwood he couldn’t compete with Chinese porcelain, yet he learned from the Lunar Society and built an English pottery industry that led the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying the Lunar Society’s virtues to contemporary industry leads Mindell to a core set of ideas about technology. Research shows that design and manufacturing should be adjacent if possible, not outsourced globally, to accelerate learning and collaboration. The book also argues that technology should address human needs and that venture capital should focus more on industrial systems than it does. (Mindell has co-founded a firm, called Unless, that invests in companies by using venture financing structures better-suited to industrial transformation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeing a new industrialism&amp;nbsp;taking shape, Mindell suggests that&amp;nbsp;its future includes&amp;nbsp;new ways of working, collaborating, and&amp;nbsp;valuing knowledge throughout organizations, as well as more AI-based open-source tools for small and mid-size manufacturers. He also contends that a new industrialism should include greater emphasis on maintenance and repair work, which are valuable sources of knowledge about industrial devices and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve undervalued how to keep things running, while simultaneously hollowing out the middle of the workforce,” he says. “And yet, operations and maintenance are sites of product innovation. Ask the person who fixes your car or dishwasher. They’ll tell you the strengths and weaknesses of every model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, “The sum total of this work, over time, amounts to a new industrialism if it elevates its cultural status into a movement that values the material basis of our lives and seeks to improve it, literally from the ground up,” Mindell writes in the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The book doesn’t predict the future,” he says. “But rather it suggests how to talk about the future of industry with optimism and realism, as opposed to saying, this is the utopian future where machines do everything, and people just sit back in chairs with wires coming out of their heads.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work of the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The New Lunar Society” is a concise book with expansive ideas. Mindell also devotes chapters to the convergence of the Industrial-era Enlightenment, the founding of the U.S., and the crucial role of industry in forming the republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only founding father who signed all of the critical documents in the founding of the country, Benjamin Franklin, was also the person who crystallized the modern science of electricity and deployed its first practical invention, the lightning rod,” Mindell says. “But there were multiple figures, including Thomas Jefferson and Paul Revere, who integrated the industrial Enlightenment with democracy. Industry has been core to American democracy from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, as Mindell emphasizes in the book, “industry,” beyond evoking smokestacks, has a human meaning: If you are hard-working, you are displaying industry. That meshes with the idea of persistently redeveloping an invention over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the high regard Mindell holds for the Industrial Enlightenment, he recognizes that the era’s industrialization brought harsh working conditions, as well as environmental degradation. As one of the co-founders of MIT’s Work of the Future initiative, he argues that 21st-century industrialism needs to rethink some of its fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ideals of [British] industrialization missed on the environment, and missed on labor,” Mindell says. “So at this point, how do we rethink industrial systems to do better?” Mindell argues that industry must power an economy that grows while decarbonizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, Mindell adds, “About 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from industrial sectors, and all of the potential solutions involve making lots of new stuff. Even if it’s just connectors and wire. We’re not going to decarbonize or address global supply chain crises by deindustrializing, we’re going to get there by reindustrializing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The New Lunar Society” has received praise from technologists and other scholars. Joel Mokyr, an economic historian at Northwestern University who coined the term “Industrial Enlightenment,” has stated that Mindell “realizes that innovation requires a combination of knowing and making, mind and hand. … He has written a deeply original and insightful book.”&amp;nbsp;Jeff Wilke SM ’93, a former CEO of Amazon’s consumer business, has said the book “argues compellingly that a thriving industrial base, adept at both product and process innovation, underpins a strong democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mindell hopes the audience for the book will range from younger technologists to a general audience of anyone interested in the industrial future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think about young people in industrial settings and want to help them see they’re part of a great tradition and are doing important things to change the world,” Mindell says. “There is a huge audience of people who are interested in technology but find overhyped language does not match their aspirations or personal experience. I’m trying to crystallize this new industrialism as a way of imagining and talking about the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-71a39dd2-7fff-e9c5-8eaf-2adf4224d5eb"&gt;Steven Strang, a writer and literary scholar who founded MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/"&gt;Writing and Communication Center&lt;/a&gt; in 1981 and directed it for 40 years, died with family at his side on Dec. 29, 2024. He was 77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His vision for the center was ambitious. After an MIT working group identified gaps between the students’ technical knowledge and their ability to communicate it — particularly once in positions of leadership — Strang advocated an even broader approach rarely used at other universities. Rather than student-tutors working with peers, Strang hired instructors with doctorates, subject matter expertise, and teaching experience to help train&amp;nbsp;all MIT community members for the current and future careers becoming increasingly reliant on persuasion and the need to communicate with varied audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“He made an indelible mark on the MIT community,” wrote current director Elena Kallestinova in a message to WCC staff soon after Strang’s death. “He was deeply respected as a leader, educator, mentor, and colleague.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Beginning his professional life as a journalist with the &lt;em&gt;Bangor&amp;nbsp;Daily News&lt;/em&gt;, Strang soon shifted to academia, receiving a PhD in English from Brown University and over the decades publishing countless pieces of fiction, poetry, and criticism, in addition to his pedagogical articles on writing and rhetoric.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But the Writing and Communication Center is his legacy. At a retirement party, longtime MIT lecturer and colleague Thalia Rubio called the WCC “Steve’s creation,” pointing out that it went on to serve many thousands of students and others. Another colleague, Bob Irwin, described in a note Strang’s commitment to making the WCC “a place that offered both friendliness and the highest professional standards of advice and consultation on all communication tasks and issues. Steve himself was conscientious, a respectful director, and a warm and reliable mentor to me and others. I think he was exemplary in his job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT recognized Strang’s major contributions with a Levitan Teaching Award, an Infinite Mile Award, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://hr.mit.edu/rewards/recipient/award-recipients/2004-2005/going-above-and-beyond/steven-strang"&gt;an Excellence Award&lt;/a&gt;. In nomination letters and testimonials, students and peers alike told of a “tireless commitment,” that “they might not have graduated, or been hired to the job they have today, or gained admittance to graduate school had it not been for the help of The Writing Center.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Strang is also remembered for his work&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-best-kept-secret-writers-group-1010"&gt;founding the MIT Writers Group&lt;/a&gt;, which he first offered as a creative writing workshop for Independent Activities Period in 2002. In yet another example of Strang recognizing and meeting a community need, about 70 people from across the Institute showed up that first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strang is survived by a large extended family, including his wife Ayni and her two children, Elly and Marta, whom Strang adopted as his own. Donations in his memory can be made to &lt;a href="https://www.rispca.org/tribute-gifts"&gt;The Rhode Island Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Lauren Rebecca Thacker | MIT Open Learning</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" paraid="47805235" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{88}"&gt;Shreya Mogulothu is naturally curious. As a high school student in New Jersey, she was interested in mathematics and theoretical computer science (TCS). So, when her curiosity compelled her to learn more, she turned to MIT Open Learning’s online resources and completed the &lt;a href="https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+24.118x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Paradox and Infinity&lt;/a&gt; course on &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Online.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="229597260" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{113}"&gt;“Coming from a math and TCS background, the idea of pushing against the limits of assumptions was really interesting,” says Mogulothu, now a junior at MIT. “I mean, who wouldn’t want to learn more about infinity?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="284799756" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{127}"&gt;The class, taught by Agustín Rayo, professor of philosophy and the current dean of the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, and David Balcarras, a former instructor in philosophy and fellow in the Digital Learning Lab at Open Learning, explores the intersection of math and philosophy and guides learners through thinking about paradoxes and open-ended problems, as well as the boundaries of theorizing and the limits of standard mathematical tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="660947054" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{143}"&gt;“We talked about taking regular assumptions about numbers and objects and pushing them to extremes,” Mogulothu says. “For example, what contradictions arise when you talk about an infinite set of things, like the infinite hats paradox?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1235235767" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{153}"&gt;The infinite hats paradox, also known as Bacon’s Puzzle, involves an infinite line of people, each wearing one of two colors of hats. The puzzle posits that each individual can see only the hat of the person in front of them and must guess the color of their own hat. The puzzle challenges students to identify if there is a strategy that can ensure the least number of incorrect answers and to consider how strategy may change if there is a finite number of people. Mogulothu was thrilled that a class like this was available to her even though she wasn’t yet affiliated with MIT.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1652197076" paraeid="{a4259f3c-4f1e-4fa7-a473-b4b805188ae8}{233}"&gt;“My &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; experience was one of the reasons I came to MIT,” she says. “I really liked the course, and I was happy it was shared with people like me, who didn’t even go to the school. I thought that a place that encouraged even people outside of campus to learn like that would be a pretty good place to study.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2041449983" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{18}"&gt;Looking back at the course, Balcarras says, “Shreya may have been the most impressive student in our online community of approximately 3,900 learners and 100 verified learners. I cannot single out another student whose performance rivaled hers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="2048737798" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{40}"&gt;Because of her excellent performance, Mogulothu was invited to submit her work to the &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sts-042-einstein-oppenheimer-feynman-physics-in-the-20th-century-fall-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;2021 &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Philosophy Awards.&lt;/a&gt; She won. In fact, Balcarras remembers, both papers she wrote for the course would have won. They demonstrated, he says, “an unusually high degree of precision, formal acumen, and philosophical subtlety for a high school student.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="281279263" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{73}"&gt;Completing the course and winning the award was rewarding, Mogulothu says. It motivated her to keep exploring new things as a high school student, and then as a new student enrolled at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="362508324" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{89}"&gt;She came to college thinking she would declare a major in math or computer science. But when she looked at the courses she was most interested in, she realized she should pursue a physics major.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1132034822" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{115}"&gt;She has enjoyed the courses in her major, especially class STS.042J/8.225J (Einstein, Oppenheimer, Feynman: Physics in the 20th Century), taught by David Kaiser, the Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and professor of physics. She took the course on campus, but it is also available on Open Learning’s &lt;a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sts-042-einstein-oppenheimer-feynman-physics-in-the-20th-century-fall-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MIT OpenCourseWare.&lt;/a&gt; As a student, she continues to use MIT Open Learning resources to check out courses and review syllabi as she plans her coursework.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1985279570" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{154}"&gt;In summer 2024, Mogulothu did research on gravitational wave detection at PIER, the partnership between research center DESY and the University of Hamburg, in Hamburg, Germany. She wants to pursue a PhD in physics to keep researching, expanding her mind, and indulging the curiosity that led her to &lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; in the first place. She encourages all learners to feel comfortable and confident trying something entirely new.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p paraid="1253127952" paraeid="{dfeb90ae-5dd8-4f6c-905e-0a3ae27ae3e8}{188}"&gt;“I went into the Paradox and Infinity course thinking, ‘yeah, math is cool, computer science is cool,’” she says. “But, actually taking the course and learning about things you don’t even expect to exist is really powerful. It increases your curiosity and is super rewarding to stick with something and realize how much you can learn and grow.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT philosopher Sally Haslanger&amp;nbsp;has been named the 2024 recipient of the prestigious&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.apaonline.org/page/quinn?&amp;amp;hhsearchterms=%22quinn+and+prize%22"&gt;Philip L. Quinn Prize&lt;/a&gt; from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.apaonline.org/"&gt;American Philosophical Association&lt;/a&gt; (APA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The award recognizes Haslanger’s lifelong contributions to philosophy and philosophers.&amp;nbsp;Haslanger, the&amp;nbsp;Ford Professor of Philosophy and Women’s and Gender Studies, says she is deeply honored by the recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“So many philosophers I deeply respect have come before me as awardees, including Judith Jarvis Thomson, my former colleague and lifelong inspiration,” Haslanger says. “Judy and I both were deeply engaged in doing metaphysics with an eye toward the moral/political domain. Both of us were committed feminists in a time when it was not professionally easy. Both of us believed in the power of institutions, such as the APA and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.aaup.org/"&gt;American Association of University Professors&lt;/a&gt; (AAUP), to sustain a flourishing intellectual community. Both of us have&amp;nbsp;demanded that institutions we are part of&amp;nbsp;abide by their values.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Haslanger joined the MIT faculty in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her research features explorations of the social construction of categories like gender, race, and the family; social explanation and social structure; and topics in feminist epistemology. She has also published in metaphysics and critical race theory. Broadly speaking, her work links issues of social justice with contemporary work in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Her book,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/resisting-reality-9780199892624?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;"&gt;Resisting Reality: Social Construction and Social Critique&lt;/a&gt;” (Oxford University Press, 2012), was awarded the Joseph B. Gittler prize for outstanding work in the philosophy of social science.&amp;nbsp;She also co-authored&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/what-is-race-9780190610180?q=What%20is%20Race:%20Four%20Philosophical%20Views&amp;amp;cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;What is Race: Four Philosophical Views&lt;/a&gt;” (Oxford University Press, 2019). Her current book,&amp;nbsp;“Doing Justice to the Social” (under contract with Oxford University Press), develops an account of social practices and structures, emphasizing their materiality, the role of ideology, and potential grounds for critique. She&amp;nbsp;continues to document and ameliorate the underrepresentation of women and other minorities in philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Haslanger, a former president of the Eastern Division of the APA, singles out the collaborative nature of the field while also celebrating her peers’ recognition, noting her work is “inspired, nourished, and scaffolded by others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Judy was a notable inspiration (and a clear example of how hard such work can be), but there are so many others who have been on this journey with me and kept me going, including feminist colleagues across the country and abroad, graduate students, staff members, and allies from many different disciplines and professions,” Haslanger says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Awarded annually since 2007, the Quinn Prize honors the memory of Philip L. Quinn, a noted philosopher from the University of Notre Dame who served as president of the APA Central Division for many years. The prize carries a $2,500 award and an engraved plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Kieran Setiya, the Peter de Florez Professor of Philosophy and head of the Department of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://linguistics.mit.edu/"&gt;Linguistics&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/"&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;, says Haslanger has played a “transformative role in philosophy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Sally’s influence on the field has been vast. Bridging a deep divide, she has brought critical social theory into conversation with analytic philosophy, arguing for an account of social structures and practices that does justice to their materiality,” Setiya says. “This work earned her a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gf.org/"&gt;Guggenheim Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; as well as membership in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.amacad.org/"&gt;American Academy of Arts and Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, along with invitations to give lectures named after canonical philosophers past and present: Wittgenstein, Benjamin, Hempel, Kant, Spinoza, and others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Setiya noted Haslanger’s substantial contributions to the field, including her role in founding the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://piksiboston.weebly.com/"&gt;Philosophy in an Inclusive Key Summer Institute&lt;/a&gt; (PIKSI) in Boston, which for 10 years has brought diverse undergraduates to MIT to show them that&amp;nbsp;graduate study in philosophy is a meaningful option for them and to mentor them as they apply to graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As Sally’s colleague, I am in awe not just of her extraordinary philosophical and professional achievements, but of her integrity and the seemingly limitless energy she invests in her students, in the Philosophy Section, in MIT, in the profession, and in fighting for social justice in the world from which academia is inextricable,” Setiya adds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Global Languages program empowers student ambassadors</title>

  <description><![CDATA[The Student Ambassadors program offers MIT undergraduates from across language areas opportunities to share their voices, passion, and commitment with the community.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Benjamin Daniel | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Angelina Wu has been taking &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/japanese-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; classes at MIT since arriving as a first-year student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I have had such a wonderful experience learning the language, getting to know my classmates, and interacting with the Japanese community at MIT,” says Wu, now a senior majoring in computer science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s been an integral part of my MIT experience, supplementing my other technical skills and also giving me opportunities to meet many people outside my major that I likely wouldn’t have had otherwise. As a result, I feel like I get to understand a much broader, more complete version of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now, Wu is sharing her experience and giving back as a &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/people-type/student-ambassadors/" target="_blank"&gt;Global Languages Student Ambassador&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;At a recent Global Languages preregistration fair, Wu spoke with other students interested in pursuing Japanese studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I could not be happier to help promote such an experience to curious students and the greater MIT community,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Global Language Student Ambassadors is a group of students who lead&amp;nbsp;outreach efforts to help increase visibility for the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In addition to disseminating information and promotional materials to the MIT undergraduate community, student ambassadors are asked to organize and host informal gatherings for Global Languages students around themes related to language and cultural exploration to build community and provide opportunities for learning and fun outside of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Global Languages director Per Urlaub isn’t surprised that the Student Ambassadors program is popular with both students and the MIT community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The Global Languages program brings people together,” he says. “Providing a caring learning environment and creating a sense of belonging are central to our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;What’s also central to the Global Languages’ mission is centering students’ work and creating spaces in which language learning can help create connections across academic areas. Students who study languages&amp;nbsp;may improve their understanding of the cultural facets that underlie communication across cultures and open new worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“An engaging community that fosters a deep sense of belonging doesn’t just happen automatically,” Urlaub notes.&amp;nbsp;“A stronger community elevates our students’ proficiency gains, and also makes language learning more meaningful and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Each student ambassador serves for a single academic year in their area of language focus. They work closely with MIT’s academic administrators to plan, communicate, and stage events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I love exploring the richness of the &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/arabic-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Arabic&lt;/a&gt; language, especially how it connects to my culture and heritage,” says Heba Hussein, a student ambassador studying Arabic and majoring in electrical science and engineering. “I believe that having a strong grasp of languages and cultural awareness will help me work effectively in diverse teams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Student ambassadors, alongside other language learners, discover how other languages, cultures, and countries can guide their communications with others while shaping how they understand the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“My &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/spanish-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt; courses at MIT have been a highlight of my college experience thus far — the opportunity to connect on a deeper level with other cultures and force myself out of my comfort zone in conversations is important to me,” says Katie Kempff, another student ambassador who is majoring in climate system science and engineering and Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As a heritage speaker, learning &lt;a href="https://languages.mit.edu/areas-of-study/chinese-studies/" target="_blank"&gt;Chinese&lt;/a&gt; has been a way for me to connect with my culture and my roots,” adds Zixuan Liu, a double major in biological engineering and biology, and a Chinese student ambassador, who says that as a heritage speaker, learning Chinese has been a way for her to connect with her culture and her roots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I would highly recommend diving into languages and culture at MIT, where the support and the community really enhances the experience,” Liu says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Loren R. Graham, professor emeritus of the history of science who served on the MIT faculty for nearly three decades, died on Dec. 15, 2024, at the age of 91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham received a BS in chemical engineering from Purdue University in 1955, the same year his classmate, acquaintance, and future NASA astronaut and moon walker Neil Armstrong graduated with a BS in aeronautical engineering. Graham went on to earn a PhD in history in 1964 from Columbia University, where he taught from 1965 until 1978.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1978, Graham joined the MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) as a professor of the history of science. His specialty during his tenure with the program was in the history of science in Russia and the Soviet Union in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries. His work focused on Soviet and Marxist philosophy of science and science politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Graham’s career spanned the Cold War. He participated in one of the first academic exchange programs between the United States and the Soviet Union from 1960 to 1961 and marched in the Moscow May Day Parade just weeks after Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. In 1965, he received a Fulbright Award to do research in the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham wrote extensively on the influence of social context in science and the study of contemporary science and technology in Russia. He also experimented in writing a nonfiction mystery, “Death in the Lighthouse”&amp;nbsp;(2013),&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and making documentary films. His publications include “Science, Philosophy and Human Behavior in the Soviet Union” (1987), “Science and the Soviet Social Order” (1990), “Science in Russia and the Soviet Union: A Short History” (1993), “The Ghost of the Executed Engineer” (1993); “A Face in the Rock” (1995); and “What Have We Learned About Science and Technology from the Russian Experience?”&amp;nbsp;(1998).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His publication “Science, Philosophy and Science in the Soviet Union” was nominated for the National Book Award in 1987. He received the George Sarton Medal from the History of Science Society in 1996 and the Follo Award of the Michigan Historical Society in 2000 for his contributions to Michigan history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many former colleagues recall the impact he had at MIT. In 1988, with fellow faculty member Merritt Roe Smith, professor emeritus of history, he played a leading role in establishing the graduate program in the history and social study of science and technology that is now known as HASTS. This interdisciplinary graduate Program in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society has become one of the most selective graduate programs at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loren was an intellectual innovator and role model for teaching and advising,” says Sherry Turkle, MIT professor of sociology. “And he was a wonderful colleague. … He experimented. He had fun. He cared about writing and about finding joy in work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham served on the STS faculty until his retirement in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, Graham was a member of many foundations and honorary societies, including the U.S. Civilian Research and Development Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Russian Academy of Natural Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was also a member on several boards of trustees, including George Soros' International Science Foundation, which supported Russian scientists after the collapse of the Soviet Union. For many years he served on the board of trustees of the European University at St. Petersburg, remaining an active member on its development board until 2024. After donating thousands of books from his own library to the university, a special collection was established in his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Graham was awarded a medal by the Russian Academy of Sciences at a ceremony in Moscow for his contributions to the history of science. “His own life as a scholar covered a great deal of important history,” says David Mindell, MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics and the Dibner Professor of the History of Engineering and Manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham is survived by ​​his wife, Patricia Graham, and daughter, Meg Peterson.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Why open secrets are a big problem</title>

  <description><![CDATA[Philosopher Sam Berstler diagnoses the corrosive effects of not acknowledging troubling truths.]]></description>

    <guid isPermaLink="true">https://news.mit.edu/2024/why-open-secrets-are-a-big-problem-1223</guid>
        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that the head of a company office is misbehaving, and a disillusioned employee reports the problem to their manager. Instead of the complaint getting traction, however, the manager sidesteps the issue and implies that raising it further could land the unhappy employee in trouble — but doesn’t deny that the problem exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hypothetical scenario involves an open secret: a piece of information that is widely known but never acknowledged as such. Open secrets often create practical quandaries for people, as well as backlash against those who try to address the things that the secrets protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a newly published paper, MIT philosopher Sam Berstler contends that open secrets are pervasive and problematic enough to be worthy of systematic study — and provides a detailed analysis of the distinctive social dynamics accompanying them. In many cases, she proposes, ignoring some things is fine — but open secrets present a special problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, people might maintain friendships better by not disclosing their salaries to each other, and relatives might get along better if they avoid talking politics at the holidays. But these are just run-of-the-mill individual decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, open secrets are especially damaging, Berstler believes, because of their “iterative” structure. We do not talk about open secrets; we do not talk about the fact that we do not talk about them; and so on, until the possibility of addressing the problems at hand disappears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes not acknowledging things can be very productive,” Berstler says. “It’s good we don’t talk about everything in the workplace. What’s different about open secrecy is not the content of what we’re not acknowledging, but the pernicious iterative structure of our practice of not acknowledging it.&amp;nbsp; And because of that structure, open secrecy tends to be hard to change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, as she writes in the paper, “Open secrecy norms are often moral disasters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Berstler says, the example of open secrets should enable us to examine the nature of conversation itself in more multidimensional terms; we need to think about the things left unsaid in conversation, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berstler’s paper, “&lt;a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/BERTSO-68" target="_blank"&gt;The Structure of Open Secrets&lt;/a&gt;,” appears in advance online form in &lt;em&gt;Philosophical Review&lt;/em&gt;. Berstler, an assistant professor and the Laurance S. Rockefeller Career Development Chair in MIT’s Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, is the sole author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eroding our knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of open secrets is hardly new, but it has not been subject to extensive philosophical rigor. The German sociologist Georg Simmel wrote about them in the early 20th century, but mostly in the context of secret societies keeping quirky rituals to themselves. Other prominent thinkers have addressed open secrets in psychological terms. To Berstler, the social dynamics of open secrets merit a more thorough reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a psychological problem that people are having,” she says. “It’s a particular practice that they’re all conforming to. But it’s hard to see this because it’s the kind of practice that members, just in virtue of conforming to the practice, can’t talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Berstler’s view, the iterative nature of open secrets distinguishes them. The employee expecting a candid reply from their manager may feel bewildered about the lack of a transparent response, and that nonacknowledgement means there is not much recourse to be had, either. Eventually, keeping open secrets means the original issue itself can be lost from view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Open secrets norms are set up to try to erode our knowledge,” Berstler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practical terms, people may avoid addressing open secrets head-on because they face a familiar quandary: Being a whistleblower can cost people their jobs and more. But Berstler suggests in the paper that keeping open secrets helps people define their in-group status, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also the basis for group identity,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berstler avoids taking the position that greater transparency is automatically a beneficial thing.&amp;nbsp;The paper identifies at least one kind of special case where keeping open secrets might be good. Suppose, for instance, a co-worker has an eccentric but harmless habit their colleagues find out about: It might be gracious to spare them simple embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That aside, as Berstler writes, open secrets “can serve as shields for powerful people guilty of serious, even criminal wrongdoing. The norms can compound the harm that befalls their victims … [who] find they don’t just&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;have to contend with the perpetrator’s financial resources, political might, and interpersonal capital. They must go up against an entire social arrangement.” As a result, the chances of fixing social or organizational dysfunction diminish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two layers of conversation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berstler is not only trying to chart the dynamics and problems of open secrets. She is also trying to usefully complicate our ideas about the nature of conversations and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, some philosophers have theorized about conversations and communication by focusing largely on the information being shared among people. To Berstler, this is not quite sufficient; the example of open secrets alerts us that communication is not just an act of making things more and more transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I’m arguing in the paper is that this is too simplistic a way to think about it, because actual conversations in the real world have a theatrical or dramatic structure,” Berstler says. “There are things that cannot be made explicit without ruining the performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an office holiday party, for instance, the company CEO might maintain an illusion of being on equal footing with the rest of the employees if the conversation is restricted to movies and television shows. If the subject turns to year-end bonuses, that illusion vanishes. Or two friends at a party, trapped in an unwanted conversation with a third person, might maneuver themselves away with knowing comments, but without explicitly saying they are trying to end the chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here Berstler draws upon the work of sociologist Erving Goffman — who closely studied the performative aspects of everyday behavior — to outline how a more multi-dimensional conception of social interaction applies to open secrets. Berstler suggests open secrets involve what she calls “activity layering,” which in this case suggests that people in a conversation involving open secrets have multiple common grounds for understanding, but some remain unspoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further expanding on Goffman’s work, Berstler also details how people may be “mutually collaborating on a pretense,” as she writes, to keep an open secret going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Goffman has not really systematically been brought into the philosophy of language, so I am showing how his ideas illuminate and complicate philosophical views,” Berstler says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, a close analysis of open secrets and a re-evaluation of the performative components of conversation can help us become more cognizant about communication. What is being said matters; what is left unsaid matters alongside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are structural features of open secrets that are worrisome,” Berstler says. “And because of that we have to more aware [of how they work].”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Danna Lorch | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brought together as part of the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/"&gt;Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt; (SERC) initiative within the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, a community of students known as &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/cross-cutting/social-and-ethical-responsibilities-of-computing/serc-scholars-program/"&gt;SERC Scholars&lt;/a&gt; is collaborating to examine the most urgent problems humans face in the digital landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each semester, students from all levels from across MIT are invited to join a different topical working group led by a SERC postdoctoral associate. Each group delves into a specific issue — such as surveillance or data ownership — culminating in a final project presented at the end of the term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, students complete the program with hands-on experience conducting research in a new cross-disciplinary field. However, one group of undergraduate and graduate students recently had the unique opportunity to enhance their resume by becoming published authors of a case study about the environmental and climate justice implications of the electronics hardware life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s not uncommon for graduate students to co-author case studies, it’s unusual for undergraduates to earn this opportunity — and for their audience to be other undergraduates around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team was insanely interdisciplinary,” says Anastasia Dunca, a junior studying computer science and one of the co-authors. “I joined the SERC Scholars Program&amp;nbsp;because I liked the idea of being part of a cohort from across MIT working on a project that utilized all of our skillsets. It also helps [undergraduates] learn the ins and outs of computing ethics research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Case study co-author Jasmin Liu, an MBA student in the MIT Sloan School of Management,&amp;nbsp;sees&amp;nbsp;the program as a platform to learn about the intersection of technology, society, and ethics:&amp;nbsp;“I met team members spanning computer science, urban planning, to art/culture/technology. I was excited to work with a diverse team because I know complex problems must be approached with many different perspectives. Combining my background in humanities and business with the expertise of others allowed us to be more innovative and comprehensive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Rabe, a former SERC postdoc who facilitated the group, says, “I let the students take the lead on identifying the topic and conducting the research.” His goal for the group was to challenge students across disciplines to develop a working definition of climate justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From mining to e-waste&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SERC Scholars’ case study, “&lt;a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/pub/w9ht6hue/release/5"&gt;From Mining to E-waste: The Environmental and Climate Justice Implications of the Electronics Hardware Life Cycle&lt;/a&gt;,” was published by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mit-serc.pubpub.org/"&gt;MIT Case Studies in Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ongoing case studies series, which releases new issues twice a year on an open-source platform, is enabling undergraduate instructors worldwide to incorporate research-based education materials on computing ethics into their existing class syllabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This particular case study broke down the electronics life cycle from mining to manufacturing, usage, and disposal. It offered an in-depth look at how this cycle promotes inequity in the Global South. Mining for the average of 60 minerals that power everyday devices lead to illegal deforestation, compromising air quality in the Amazon, and triggering armed conflict in Congo. Manufacturing leads to proven health risks for both formal and informal workers, some of whom are child laborers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life cycle assessment and circular economy are proposed as mechanisms for analyzing environmental and climate justice issues in the electronics life cycle. Rather than posing solutions, the case study offers readers entry points for further discussion and for assessing their own individual responsibility as producers of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crufting and crafting a case study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunca joined Rabe's working group, intrigued by the invitation to conduct a rigorous literature review examining issues like data center resource and energy use, manufacturing waste, ethical issues with AI, and climate change. Rabe quickly realized that a common thread among all participants was an interest in understanding and reducing e-waste and its impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came in with the idea of us co-authoring a case study,” Rabe said. However, the writing-intensive process was initially daunting to those students who were used to conducting applied research. Once Rabe created sub-groups with discrete tasks, the steps for researching, writing, and iterating a case study became more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ellie Bultena, an undergraduate student studying linguistics and philosophy and a contributor to the study, that meant conducting field research on the loading dock of MIT’s Stata Center, where students and faculty go “crufting” through piles of clunky printers, broken computers, and used lab equipment discarded by the Institute's labs, departments, and individual users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although not a formally sanctioned activity on-campus, “crufting” is the act of gleaning usable parts from these junk piles to be repurposed into new equipment or art. Bultena’s respondents, who opted to be anonymous, said that MIT could do better when it comes to the amount of e-waste generated and suggested that formal strategies could be implemented to encourage community members to repair equipment more easily or recycle more formally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rabe, now an education program director at the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, is hopeful that through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://sustainability.mit.edu/topic/zero-carbon-campus"&gt;Zero-Carbon Campus Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which commits MIT to eliminating all direct emissions by 2050, MIT will ultimately become a model for other higher education institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the group lacked the time and resources to travel to communities in the Global South that they profiled in their case study, members leaned into exhaustive secondary research, collecting data on how some countries are irresponsibly dumping e-waste. In contrast, others have developed alternative solutions that can be duplicated elsewhere and scaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We source materials, manufacture them, and then throw them away,” Lelia Hampton says. A PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science and another co-author,&amp;nbsp;Hampton jumped at the opportunity to serve in a writing role, bringing together the sub-groups research findings. “I’d never written a case study, and it was exciting. Now I want to write 10 more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The content directly informed Hampton’s dissertation research, which “looks at applying machine learning to climate justice issues such as urban heat islands.” She said that writing a case study that is accessible to general audiences upskilled her for the non-profit organization she’s determined to start. “It’s going to provide communities with free resources and data needed to understand how they are impacted by climate change and begin to advocate against injustice,” Hampton explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunca, Liu, Rabe, Bultena, and Hampton are joined on the case study by fellow authors Mrinalini Singha, a graduate student in the Art, Culture, and Technology program; Sungmoon Lim, a graduate student in urban studies and planning and EECS; Lauren Higgins, an undergraduate majoring in political science; and Madeline Schlegel, a Northeastern University co-op student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking the case study to classrooms around the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although PhD candidates have contributed to previous case studies in the series, this publication is the first to be co-authored with MIT undergraduates. Like any other peer-reviewed journal, before publication, the SERC Scholars’ case study was anonymously reviewed by senior scholars drawn from various fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series editor, David Kaiser, also served as one of SERC’s inaugural associate deans and helped shape the program. “The case studies, by design, are short, easy to read, and don't take up lots of time,” Kaiser explained. “They are gateways for students to explore, and instructors can cover a topic that has likely already been on their mind.” This semester, Kaiser, the Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and a professor of physics, is teaching STS.004 (Intersections: Science, Technology, and the World), an undergraduate introduction to the field of science, technology, and society. The last month of the semester has been dedicated wholly to SERC case studies, one of which is:&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;“From Mining to E-Waste.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hampton was visibly moved to hear that the case study is being used at MIT but also by some of the 250,000 visitors to the SERC platform, many of whom are based in the Global South and directly impacted by the issues she and her cohort researched. “Many students are focused on climate, whether through computer science, data science, or mechanical engineering. I hope that this case study educates them on environmental and climate aspects of e-waste and computing.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For all the talk about artificial intelligence upending the world, its economic effects remain uncertain. There is massive investment in AI but little clarity about what it will produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining AI has become a significant part of Nobel-winning economist Daron Acemoglu’s work. An Institute Professor at MIT, Acemoglu has long studied the impact of technology in society, from modeling the large-scale adoption of innovations to conducting empirical studies about the impact of robots on jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Acemoglu also shared the 2024 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel with two collaborators, Simon Johnson PhD ’89 of the MIT Sloan School of Management and James Robinson of the University of Chicago, for research on the relationship between political institutions and economic growth. Their work shows that democracies with robust rights sustain better growth over time than other forms of government do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since a lot of growth comes from technological innovation, the way societies use AI is of keen interest to Acemoglu, who has published a variety of papers about the economics of the technology in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where will the new tasks for humans with generative AI come from?” asks Acemoglu. “I don’t think we know those yet, and that’s what the issue is. What are the apps that are really going to change how we do things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the measurable effects of AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1947, U.S. GDP growth has averaged about 3 percent annually, with productivity growth at about 2 percent annually. Some predictions have claimed AI will double growth or at least create a higher growth trajectory than usual. By contrast, in one paper, “&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/economicpolicy/advance-article/doi/10.1093/epolic/eiae042/7728473" target="_blank"&gt;The Simple Macroeconomics of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in the August issue of &lt;em&gt;Economic Policy&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu estimates that over the next decade, AI will produce a “modest increase” in GDP between 1.1 to 1.6 percent over the next 10 years, with a roughly 0.05 percent annual gain in productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu’s assessment is based on recent estimates about how many jobs are affected by AI, including a 2023 study by researchers at OpenAI, OpenResearch, and the University of Pennsylvania, which finds that about 20 percent of U.S. job tasks might be exposed to AI capabilities. A 2024 study by researchers from MIT FutureTech, as well as the Productivity Institute and IBM, finds that about 23 percent of computer vision tasks that can be ultimately automated could be profitably done so within the next 10 years. Still more research suggests the average cost savings from AI is about 27 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to productivity, “I don’t think we should belittle 0.5 percent in 10 years. That’s better than zero,” Acemoglu says. “But it’s just disappointing relative to the promises that people in the industry and in tech journalism are making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is an estimate, and additional AI applications may emerge: As Acemoglu writes in the paper, his calculation does not include the use of AI to predict the shapes of proteins — for which other scholars subsequently shared a Nobel Prize in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other observers have suggested that “reallocations” of workers displaced by AI will create additional growth and productivity, beyond Acemoglu’s estimate, though he does not think this will matter much. “Reallocations, starting from the actual allocation that we have, typically generate only small benefits,” Acemoglu says. “The direct benefits are the big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “I tried to write the paper in a very transparent way, saying what is included and what is not included. People can disagree by saying either the things I have excluded are a big deal or the numbers for the things included are too modest, and that’s completely fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which jobs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conducting such estimates can sharpen our intuitions about AI. Plenty of forecasts about AI have described it as revolutionary; other analyses are more circumspect. Acemoglu’s work helps us grasp on what scale we might expect changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s go out to 2030,” Acemoglu says. “How different do you think the U.S. economy is going to be because of AI? You could be a complete AI optimist and think that millions of people would have lost their jobs because of chatbots, or perhaps that some people have become super-productive workers because with AI they can do 10 times as many things as they’ve done before. I don’t think so. I think most companies are going to be doing more or less the same things. A few occupations will be impacted, but we’re still going to have journalists, we’re still going to have financial analysts, we’re still going to have HR employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that is right, then AI most likely applies to a bounded set of white-collar tasks, where large amounts of computational power can process a lot of inputs faster than humans can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to impact a bunch of office jobs that are about data summary, visual matching, pattern recognition, et cetera,” Acemoglu adds. “And those are essentially about 5 percent of the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Acemoglu and Johnson have sometimes been regarded as skeptics of AI, they view themselves as realists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying not to be bearish,” Acemoglu says. “There are things generative AI can do, and I believe that, genuinely.” However, he adds, “I believe there are ways we could use generative AI better and get bigger gains, but I don’t see them as the focus area of the industry at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine usefulness, or worker replacement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Acemoglu says we could be using AI better, he has something specific in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of his crucial concerns about AI is whether it will take the form of “machine usefulness,” helping workers gain productivity, or whether it will be aimed at mimicking general intelligence in an effort to replace human jobs. It is the difference between, say, providing new information to a biotechnologist versus replacing a customer service worker with automated call-center technology. So far, he believes, firms have been focused on the latter type of case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My argument is that we currently have the wrong direction for AI,” Acemoglu says. “We’re using it too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acemoglu and Johnson delve into this issue in depth in their high-profile 2023 book “Power and Progress” (PublicAffairs), which has a straightforward&amp;nbsp;leading question: Technology creates economic growth, but who captures that economic growth? Is it elites, or do workers share in the gains?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Acemoglu and Johnson make abundantly clear, they favor technological innovations that increase worker productivity while keeping people employed, which should sustain growth better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But generative AI, in Acemoglu’s view, focuses on mimicking whole people. This yields something he has for years been calling “so-so technology,” applications that perform at best only a little better than humans, but save companies money. Call-center automation is not always more productive than people; it just costs firms less than workers do. AI applications that complement workers seem generally on the back burner of the big tech players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think complementary uses of AI will miraculously appear by themselves unless the industry devotes significant energy and time to them,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does history suggest about AI?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that technologies are often designed to replace workers is the focus of another recent paper by Acemoglu and Johnson, “&lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-091823-025129" target="_blank"&gt;Learning from Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution — and in the Age of AI&lt;/a&gt;,” published in August in &lt;em&gt;Annual Reviews in Economics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article addresses current debates over AI, especially claims that even if technology replaces workers, the ensuing growth will almost inevitably benefit society widely over time. England during the Industrial Revolution is sometimes cited as a case in point. But Acemoglu and Johnson contend that spreading the benefits of technology does not happen easily. In 19th-century England, they assert, it occurred only after decades of social struggle and worker action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Wages are unlikely to rise when workers cannot push for their share of productivity growth,” Acemoglu and Johnson write in the paper. “Today, artificial intelligence may boost average productivity, but it also may replace many workers while degrading job quality for those who remain employed. … The impact of automation on workers today is more complex than an automatic linkage from higher productivity to better wages.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper’s title refers to the social historian E.P Thompson and economist David Ricardo; the latter is often regarded as the discipline’s second-most influential thinker ever, after Adam Smith. Acemoglu and Johnson assert that Ricardo’s views went through their own evolution on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“David Ricardo made both his academic work and his political career by arguing that machinery was going to create this amazing set of productivity improvements, and it would be beneficial for society,” Acemoglu says. “And then at some point, he changed his mind, which shows he could be really open-minded. And he started writing about how if machinery replaced labor and didn’t do anything else, it would be bad for workers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intellectual evolution, Acemoglu and Johnson contend, is telling us something meaningful today: There are not forces that inexorably guarantee broad-based benefits from technology, and we should follow the evidence about AI’s impact, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the best speed for innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If technology helps generate economic growth, then fast-paced innovation might seem ideal, by delivering growth more quickly. But in another paper, “&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230353" target="_blank"&gt;Regulating Transformative Technologies&lt;/a&gt;,” from the September issue of &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;, Acemoglu and MIT doctoral student Todd Lensman suggest an alternative outlook. If some technologies contain both benefits and drawbacks, it is best to adopt them at a more measured tempo, while those problems are being mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If social damages are large and proportional to the new technology’s productivity, a higher growth rate paradoxically leads to slower optimal adoption,” the authors write in the paper. Their model suggests that, optimally, adoption should happen more slowly at first and then accelerate over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Market fundamentalism and technology fundamentalism might claim you should always go at the maximum speed for technology,” Acemoglu says. “I don’t think there’s any rule like that in economics. More deliberative thinking, especially to avoid harms and pitfalls, can be justified.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those harms and pitfalls could include damage to the job market, or the rampant spread of misinformation. Or&amp;nbsp;AI might harm consumers, in areas from online advertising to online gaming. Acemoglu examines these scenarios in another paper,&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20230589" target="_blank"&gt;When Big Data Enables Behavioral Manipulation&lt;/a&gt;,” forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;American Economic Review: Insights&lt;/em&gt;; it is co-authored with Ali Makhdoumi of Duke University, Azarakhsh Malekian of the University of Toronto, and Asu Ozdaglar of MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we are using it as a manipulative tool, or too much for automation and not enough for providing expertise and information to workers, then we would want a course correction,” Acemoglu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly others might claim innovation has less of a downside or is unpredictable enough that we should not apply any handbrakes to it. And Acemoglu and Lensman, in the September paper, are simply developing a model of innovation adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model is a response to a trend of the last decade-plus, in which many technologies are hyped are inevitable and celebrated because of their disruption. By contrast, Acemoglu and Lensman are suggesting we can reasonably judge the tradeoffs involved in particular technologies and aim to spur additional discussion about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we reach the right speed for AI adoption?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the idea is to adopt technologies more gradually, how would this occur?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, Acemoglu says, “government regulation has that role.” However, it is not clear what kinds of long-term guidelines for AI might be adopted in the U.S. or around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, he adds, if the cycle of “hype” around AI diminishes, then the rush to use it “will naturally slow down.” This may well be more likely than regulation, if AI does not produce profits for firms soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reason why we’re going so fast is the hype from venture capitalists and other investors, because they think we’re going to be closer to artificial general intelligence,” Acemoglu says. “I think that hype is making us invest badly in terms of the technology, and many businesses are being influenced too early, without knowing what to do. We wrote that paper to say, look, the macroeconomics of it will benefit us if we are more deliberative and understanding about what we’re doing with this technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this sense, Acemoglu emphasizes, hype is a tangible aspect of the economics of AI, since it drives investment in a particular vision of AI, which influences the AI tools we may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The faster you go, and the more hype you have, that course correction becomes less likely,” Acemoglu says. “It’s very difficult, if you’re driving 200 miles an hour, to make a 180-degree turn.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Migrants have become a flashpoint in global politics. But new research by an MIT political scientist, focused on West Germany and Poland after World War II, shows that in the long term, those countries developed stronger states, more prosperous economies, and more entrepreneurship after receiving a large influx of immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those findings come from a close examination, at the local level over many decades, of&amp;nbsp;the communities receiving migrants as millions of people relocated westward when Europe’s postwar borders were redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found that places experiencing large-scale displacement [immigration] wound up accumulating state capacity, versus places that did not,” says Volha Charnysh, the Ford Career Development Associate Professor in MIT’s Department of Political Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charnysh’s new book, “&lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/uprooted/CE6B3075998AD5B1FBC44F2A3C494C6A" target="_blank"&gt;Uprooted: How Post-WWII Population Transfers Remade Europe&lt;/a&gt;,” published by Cambridge University Press, challenges the notion that migrants have a negative impact on receiving communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time frame of the analysis is important. Much discussion about refugees involves the short-term strains they place on institutions or the backlash they provoke in local communities. Charnysh’s research does reveal tensions in the postwar communities that received large numbers of refugees. But her work, distinctively, also quantifies long-run outcomes, producing a different overall picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Charnysh writes in the book, “Counterintuitively, mass displacement ended up strengthening the state and improving economic performance in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extracting data from history&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World War II wrought a colossal amount of death, destruction, and suffering, including the Holocaust, the genocide of about 6 million European Jews. The ensuing peace settlement among the Allied Powers led to large-scale population transfers. Poland saw its borders moved about 125 miles west; it was granted formerly German territory while ceding eastern territory to the Soviet Union. Its new region became 80 percent filled by new migrants,&amp;nbsp;including Poles displaced from the east and voluntary migrants from other parts of the country and from abroad. West Germany received an influx of 12.5 million Germans displaced from Poland and other parts of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To study the impact of these population transfers, Charnysh used historical records to create four original quantitative datasets at the municipal and county level, while also examining archival documents, memoirs, and newspapers to better understand the texture of the time. The assignment of refugees to specific communities within Poland and West Germany amounted to&amp;nbsp;a kind of historical natural experiment, allowing her to compare how&amp;nbsp;the size and regional composition of the migrant population&amp;nbsp;affected otherwise similar areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, studying forced displacement — as opposed to the movement of a self-selected group of immigrants — meant Charnysh could rigorously examine the scaled-up effects of mass migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been an opportunity to study in a more robust way the consequences of displacement,” Charnysh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Holocaust, followed by the redrawing of borders, expulsions, and mass relocations,&amp;nbsp;appeared to increase the homogeneity of the populations within them: In 1931 Poland consisted of about one-third ethnic minorities, whereas after the war it became almost ethnically uniform. But one insight of Charnysh’s research is that shared ethnic or national identification does not guarantee social acceptance for migrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you just rearrange ethnically homogenous populations, new cleavages emerge,” Charnysh says. “People will not necessarily see others as being the same. Those who are displaced have suffered together, have a particular status in their new place, and realize their commonalities. For the native population, migrants’ arrival increased competition for jobs, housing, and state resources, so shared identities likewise emerged, and this ethnic homogeneity didn’t automatically translate into more harmonious relations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, West Germany and Poland did assimilate these groups of immgrants into their countries. In both places, state capacity grew in the decades after the war, with the countries becoming better able to administer resources for their populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The very problem, that migration and diversity can create conflict, can also create the demand for more state presence and, in cases where states are willing and able to step in,&amp;nbsp;allow for the accumulation of greater state capacity over time,” Charnysh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State investment in migrant-receiving localities paid off.&amp;nbsp;By the 1980s in West Germany, areas with greater postwar migration had higher levels of education, with more business enterprises being founded. That economic pattern emerged in Poland after it switched to a market economy in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Needed: Property rights and liberties&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Uprooted,” Charnysh also discusses the conditions in which the example of West Germany and Poland may apply to other countries. For one thing, the phenomenon of migrants bolstering the economy is likeliest to occur where states offer what the scholars Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson of MIT and James Robinson of the University of Chicago have called “inclusive institutions,” such as property rights, additional liberties, and a commitment to the rule of law. Poland, while increasing its state capacity during the Cold War, did not realize the economic benefits of migration until the Cold War ended and it changed to a more democratic government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Charnysh observes, West Germany and Poland were granting citizenship to the migrants they received, making it easier for those migrants to assimilate and make demands on the state. “My complete account probably applies best to cases where migrants receive full citizenship rights,” she acknowledges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uprooted” has earned praise from leading scholars. David Stasavage, dean for the social sciences and a professor of politics at New York University, has called the book a “pathbreaking study” that “upends what we thought we knew about the interaction between social cohesion and state capacity.” Charnysh’s research, he adds, “shows convincingly that areas with more diverse populations after the transfers saw greater improvements in state capacity and economic performance. This is a major addition to scholarship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today there may be about 100 million displaced people around the world, including perhaps 14 million Ukrainians uprooted by war. Absorbing refugees may always be a matter of political contention. But as “Uprooted” shows, countries may realize benefits from it if they take a long-term perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When states treat refugees as temporary, they don’t provide opportunities for them to contribute and assimilate,” Charnysh says. “It’s not that I don’t think cultural differences matter to people, but it’s not as big a factor as state policies.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1867, five Japanese students took a long sea voyage to Massachusetts for some advanced schooling. The group included a 13-year-old named Eiichirō&amp;nbsp;Honma, who was from one of the samurai families that ruled Japan. Honma expected to become a samurai warrior himself, and enrolled in a military academy in Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then some unexpected things happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan’s ruling dynasty, the shogunate that had run the country since the 17th century, lost power. No longer obligated to become a warrior, Honma found himself free to try other things in life. In 1870, he enrolled in the recently opened Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied civil engineering. By 1874, Honma had become MIT’s first graduate from Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honma may have thought he was going to be a military officer, but by the time he got to MIT he wanted to do something else,” says Hiromu Nagahara, an associate professor of history at MIT. “And that something else was the hottest technology of its time: railroads.” Indeed, Honma returned to Japan and became a celebrated engineer of rail lines, including one through the mountainous Usai Pass in central Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 150 years after he graduated, Honma is a central part of an exhibit about MIT’s earliest Japanese students, “&lt;a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/exhibits/exhibit/from-samurai-into-engineers/" target="_blank"&gt;From Samurai into Engineers&lt;/a&gt;,” which runs through Dec. 19 at Hayden Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibit features two other early MIT graduates from Japan. Takuma Dan, Class of 1878, was also from a samurai household, studied mining engineering at MIT, and eventually became prominent in Japan as head of the Mitsui corporation. Kiyoko Makino was the first Japanese woman and&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;the first female international student to enroll at MIT, where she studied biology from 1903 to 1905, later becoming a teacher and textbook author in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing their lives sheds light on interesting careers — and illuminates a historical period in which MIT was reaching prominence, Japan was opening itself to the world, and modern life was rolling forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at Eiichirō&amp;nbsp;Honma, Takuma Dan, and Kiyoko Makino, their lives fit the larger context of the relationship between America and Japan,” says Nagahara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The making of “From Samurai into Engineers” was a collective effort, partly generated through MIT course 21H.155/21G.555 (Modern Japan), taught by Nagahara in the spring of 2024. Students contributed to the research and wrote short historical summaries incorporated into the exhibition. The exhibit draws on original archival materials, such as the students’ letters, theses, problem sets, and other documents. Honma’s drawings for an iron girder railroad bridge, as part of his own MIT thesis, are on display, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others on campus significantly collaborated on the project from its inception. Christine Pilcavage, managing director of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://misti.mit.edu/mit-japan" target="_blank"&gt;MIT-Japan Program&lt;/a&gt;, helped encourage the development of the effort, having held an ongoing interest in the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m in awe of this relationship that we’ve had since the first Japanese students were at MIT,” Pilcavage says. “We’ve had this long connection. It shows that MIT as an Institute is always innovating. Each side had much to gain, from Honma coming to MIT, learning technology, and returning to Japan, while also mentoring other students, including Dan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the research was facilitated by MIT Libraries and its Distinctive Collections holdings, which contain the archives used for the project. Amanda Hawk, who is the public services manager in the library system, worked with Nagahara to facilitate the research by the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Distinctive Collections is excited to support faculty and student projects related to MIT history, particularly those that illuminate unknown stories or underrepresented communities,” Hawk says. “It was rewarding to collaborate with Hiromu on ‘From Samurai into Engineers’ to place these students within the context of Japanese history and the development of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that MIT had students from Japan as soon as 1870 might seem improbable on both ends of this historical connection. MIT opened in 1861 but did not start offering classes until 1865. Still, it was rapidly recognized as a significant locus of technological knowledge. Meanwhile the historic changes in Japan created a small pool of students willing to travel to Massachusetts for education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The birth of MIT in the 1860s coincides with a period of huge political economic and cultural upheaval in Japan,” Nagahara says. “It was a unique moment when there was a both a desire to go overseas and a government willingness to let people go overseas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the experience of the Japanese students at MIT seems to have been fairly smooth from the start, enabling them to have a strong focus on scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honma seemed to have been quite well-received,” Pilcavage says, who wonders if Honma’s social status — he was occasionally called “prince” — contributed to that. Still, she notes, “He was invited to other people’s homes on Thanksgiving. It didn’t seem like he faced extreme prejudice. The community welcomed him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Japanese students featured in the exhibit wound up leading distinctive lives. While Honma became a celebrated engineer, Dan was an even higher-profile figure. At MIT, he studied mining engineering with Robert Hollawell Richards, husband of Ellen Swallow Richards, MIT’s first female student and instructor. After starting as a mining engineer at Mitsui in 1888, by 1914 he had become chair of the board of the Mitsui conglomerate. Dan even came back to visit MIT twice as a distinguished alumnus, in 1910 and 1921.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan was also a committed internationalist, who believed in cooperation among nations, in contrast to the rising nationalism often present in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1932, he was shockingly assassinated outside of Mitsui headquarters in Tokyo, a victim of nationalist terrorism. Robert Richards wrote that it was “one of those terrible things which no man in his senses can understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Makino, for her part, led a much quieter life, and her status as an early student was only rediscovered in recent years by librarians working in MIT’s Distinctive Collections materials. After MIT, she returned to Japan and became a high school biology teacher in Tokyo. She also authored a textbook, “Physiology of Women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT archivists and students are continuing to research Makino’s life, and earlier this year also uncovered news articles written about her in New England newspapers while she was in the U.S. Nagahara hopes many people will continue researching MIT’s earliest Japanese students, including Sutejirō Fukuzawa, Class of 1888, the son of a well-known Japanese intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In so doing, we may gain more insight into the ways MIT, universities, and early students played concrete roles in ushering their countries into the new age. As Nagahara reflects about these students, “They’re witnessing both America and Japan become modern nation-states.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as Pilcavage notes, Honma’s status as a railroad builder “is symbolic. We continue to build bridges between our institution and Japan.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager living in a small village in what was then Yugoslavia, Admir Masic witnessed the collapse of his home country and the outbreak of the Bosnian war. When his childhood home was destroyed by a tank, his family was forced to flee the violence, leaving their remaining possessions to enter a refugee camp in northern Croatia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in Croatia that Masic found what he calls his “magic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chemistry really forcefully entered my life,” recalls Masic, who is now an associate professor in MIT’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “I’d leave school to go back to my refugee camp, and you could either play ping-pong or do chemistry homework, so I did a lot of homework, and I began to focus on the subject.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic has never let go of his magic. Long after chemistry led him out of Croatia, he’s come to understand that the past holds crucial lessons for building a better future. That’s why he started the MIT Refugee Action Hub (now &lt;a href="https://emergingtalent.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Emerging Talent&lt;/a&gt;) to provide educational opportunities to students displaced by war. It’s also what led him to study ancient materials, whose secrets he believes have potential to solve some of the modern world’s most pressing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re leading this concept of paleo-inspired design: that there are some ideas behind these ancient materials that are useful today,” Masic says. “We should think of these materials as a source of valuable information that we can try to translate to today. These concepts have the potential to revolutionize how we think about these materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key research focus for Masic is cement. His lab is working on ways to transform the ubiquitous material into a carbon sink, a medium for energy storage, and more. Part of that work involves studying ancient Roman concrete, whose self-healing properties he has helped to illuminate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the core of each of Masic’s research endeavors is a desire to translate a better understanding of materials into improvements in how we make things around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Roman concrete to me is fascinating: It’s still standing after all this time and constantly repairing,” Masic says. “It’s clear there’s something special about this material, so what is it? Can we translate part of it into modern analogues? That’s what I love about MIT. We are put in a position to do cutting-edge research and then quickly translate that research into the real world. Impact for me is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding a purpose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic’s family fled to Croatia in 1992, just as he was set to begin high school. Despite excellent grades, Masic was told Bosnian refugees couldn't enroll in the local school. It was only after a school psychologist advocated for Masic that he was allowed to sit in on classes as a nonmatriculating student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic did his best to be a ghost in the back of classrooms, silently absorbing everything he could. But in one subject he stood out. Within six months of joining the school, in January of 1993, a teacher suggested Masic compete in a local chemistry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was kind of the Olympiads of chemistry, and I won,” Masic recalls. “I literally floated onto the stage. It was this ‘Aha’ moment. I thought, ‘Oh my god, I’m good at chemistry!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Masic’s parents immigrated to Germany in search of a better life, but he decided to stay behind to finish high school, moving into a friend’s basement and receiving food and support from local families as well as a group of volunteers from Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just knew I had to stay,” Masic says. “With all the highs and lows of life to that point, I knew I had this talent and I had to make the most of it. I realized early on that knowledge was the one thing no one could take away from me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic continued competing in chemistry competitions — and continued winning. Eventually, after a change to a national law, the high school he was attending agreed to give him a diploma. With the help of the Italian volunteers, he moved to Italy to attend the University of Turin, where he entered a five-year joint program that earned him a master’s degree in inorganic chemistry. Masic stayed at the university for his PhD, where he studied parchment, a writing material that’s been used for centuries to record some of humanity’s most sacred texts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a classmate, Masic started a company that helped restore ancient documents. The work took him to Germany to work on a project studying the Dead Sea Scrolls, a set of manuscripts that date as far back as the third century BCE. In 2008, Masic joined the Max Planck Institute in Germany, where he also began to work with biological materials, studying water’s interaction with collagen at the nanoscale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through that work, Masic became an expert in Raman spectroscopy, a type of chemical imaging that uses lasers to record the vibrations of molecules without leaving a trace, which he still uses to characterize materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Raman became a tool for me to contribute in the field of biological materials and bioinspired materials,” Masic says. “At the same time, I became the ‘Raman guy.’ It was a remarkable period for me professionally, as these tools provided unparalleled information and I published a lot of papers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After seven years at Max Planck, Masic joined the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MIT, I felt I could truly be myself and define the research I wanted to do,” Masic says. “Especially in CEE, I could connect my work in heritage science and this tool, Raman spectroscopy, to tackle our society’s big challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From labs to the world&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raman spectroscopy is a relatively new approach to studying cement, a material that contributes significantly to carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. At MIT, Masic has explored ways cement could be &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-additives-concrete-effective-carbon-sink-0328" target="_blank"&gt;used to store carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-engineers-create-supercapacitor-ancient-materials-0731" target="_blank"&gt;act as an energy-storing supercapacitor&lt;/a&gt;. He has also &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/roman-concrete-durability-lime-casts-0106" target="_blank"&gt;solved ancient mysteries&lt;/a&gt; about the lasting strength of ancient Roman concrete, with lessons for the $400 billion cement industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really don’t think we should replace ordinary Portland cement completely, because it’s an extraordinary material that everyone knows how to work with, and industry produces so much of it. We need to introduce new functionalities into our concrete that will compensate for cement’s sustainability issues through avoided emissions,” Masic explains. “The concept we call ‘multifunctional concrete’ was inspired by our work with biological materials. Bones, for instance, sacrifice mechanical performance to be able to do things like self-healing and energy storage. That's how you should imagine construction over next 10 years or 20 years. There could be concrete columns and walls that primarily offer support but also do things like store energy and continuously repair themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masic's work across academia and industry allows him to apply his multifunctional concrete research at scale. He serves as a co-director of the &lt;a href="https://eccube.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT ec&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hub&lt;/a&gt;, a principal investigator within &lt;a href="https://cshub.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub&lt;/a&gt;, and a co-founder and advisor at the technology development company &lt;a href="https://dmat.co/" target="_blank"&gt;DMAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great to be at the forefront of sustainability but also to be directly interacting with key industry players that can change the world,” Masic says. “What I appreciate about MIT is how you can engage in fundamental science and engineering while also translating that work into practical applications. The CSHub and ec&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; hub are great examples of this. Industry is eager for us to develop solutions that they can help support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Masic will never forget where he came from. He now lives in Somerville, Massachusetts, with his wife Emina, a fellow former refugee, and their son, Benjamin, and the family shares a deep commitment to supporting displaced and underserved communities. Seven years ago, Masic founded the MIT Refugee Action Hub (ReACT), which provides computer and data science education programs for refugees and displaced communities. Today thousands of refugees apply to the program every year, and graduates have gone on to successful careers at places like Microsoft and Meta. &amp;nbsp;To further its reach, the ReACT program was &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-emerging-talent-opens-pathways-underserved-global-learners-0425" title="https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-emerging-talent-opens-pathways-underserved-global-learners-0425" data-outlook-id="149ec230-8e9c-4a55-9582-ff39fa2f81e3" target="_blank"&gt;recently absorbed&lt;/a&gt; by the Emerging Talent program at MIT Open Learning, where Masic is an executive faculty member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a life-changing experience for them,” Masic says. “It’s an amazing opportunity for MIT to nurture talented refugees around the world through this simple certification program. The more people we can involve, the more impact we will have on the lives of these truly underserved communities.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The banging on the tables begins almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;It’s September, and the 53 first-year students in MIT’s Concourse program are debating the pros and cons of capitalism during one of their Friday lunchtime seminars in Building 16. Sasha Rickard ’19 — assistant director of Concourse and the chair, or moderator, of the debate — reminds everyone of the rules: “Stand when you speak, address your questions and comments to the chair, and if you hear someone saying something you support, give them a little bang on the table.” The first speaker walks to the podium, praises the benefits of capitalism for her allotted four minutes, and is rewarded with a cacophony of table-banging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Other students jump up to question her argument. The next speaker takes the opposite view, denouncing capitalism. For nearly two hours, there are more speeches on both sides of the issue, more questions, more enthusiastic banging on tables. Participants call the back-and-forth “intellectually serious,” “genuine good-faith engagement,” and “incredibly fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The debate is one of the cornerstones of MIT’s Civil Discourse Project, a joint venture between the Concourse program and philosophy professors Brad Skow and Alex Byrne. The premise behind the Civil Discourse Project is that first-year students who practice talking and listening to each other even when they disagree will become more thoughtful and open-minded citizens, during their time at MIT and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It’s consistent with free expression and free speech, but also consistent with the mission of the university, which is teaching and learning and getting to a greater sense of the truth,” says Linda Rabieh, a senior lecturer in the Concourse program and co-leader of the Civil Discourse Project with Skow, Byrne, and Concourse Director Anne McCants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The project appears to be working. First-year Ace Chun, one of the student debaters, says,“It’s easy to just say, ‘Well, you have your opinion and I have mine,’ or ‘You're wrong and I'm right.’ But going through the process of disagreement and coming up with a more informed position feels really important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's debatable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Funded by the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the project launched in fall 2023 as a series of paired events. First, two scholars with opposing views on a particular subject — often one from MIT and one from another institution — participate in a formal debate on campus. A week or two later, the Concourse students, having seen the first debate, hold their own version on the same topic. Past debates have explored feminism, climate change, Covid-19 public-health policies, and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;This year’s first scholar debate explored the question “Is capitalism defensible?” and featured economist Tyler Cowen of George Mason University, who argued in the affirmative, and political scientist Alex Gourevitch of Brown University, who vigorously disagreed. Roughly 350 people registered to watch the two take turns delivering prepared remarks and answering audience questions in a large auditorium in the Stata Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These debates are open to everyone at MIT, as well as the public. They are not recorded or livestreamed because, Skow says, “we want people to feel free to say whatever’s on their mind without worrying that it’s going to be on the internet forever.” Concourse students in attendance look for ideas for what they might say in their own debate, but also, Rabieh says,&amp;nbsp;how they might say it. Cowen and Gourevitch remained respectful even when their exchanges grew louder and hotter, and they ended the evening with a handshake. Students “were seeing reasonable people disagree,” Rabieh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Five or six years ago, Rabieh had begun to notice a reluctance among students to talk about controversial ideas; they didn’t want to risk offending anyone. “Most MIT students spend a lot of their time doing math, science, or engineering, and it’s tempting for them to take refuge in the certainty of quantitative reasoning,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Today’s combative political and cultural landscape can make it even harder to get students talking about hot-button issues, and as a result, civil discourse has become something of a holy grail in higher education. Some institutions (including MIT) now incorporate free-speech exercises into their orientation programs; others host “conversation” events or offer special faculty training. Byrne sees MIT’s Civil Discourse Project, with its connection to the Concourse curriculum, as consistent, pragmatic, hands-on learning. “We’re talking instead of just talking about talking,” he says. “It's like swimming. It’s all very well to hear a lecture about pool etiquette — stay in your lane, don't dive-bomb your fellow swimmers — but at some point, you have to actually get in the pool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning to argue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Concourse’s “pool” can be found in a student lounge in Building 16. That’s where a group of “debate fellows” — older students who have gone through the Concourse program themselves — coach the first-year students in crafting statements and speeches that can be presented at a debate. It’s also where the fellows help Rabieh and Rickard adapt the original debate question into a resolution the younger students can reasonably argue about. “Our students are still figuring out what they think about a lot of things,” Rickard says. So, the question debated by Cowen and Gourevitch — Is capitalism defensible? — becomes: “Capitalism is the best economic system because it prioritizes freedom and material wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The first-year students jumped in. During their lunchtime debate, they crowded around tables, ate lasagna and salad, and waited their turn at the podium. They told personal stories to illustrate their points. They tried arguing in support of an idea that they actually disagreed with. They admitted when they were stumped. “That’s a tricky question,” one of the speakers conceded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“At a place like MIT, it’s easy to get caught up in your own world, like ‘I have this big assignment or I have this paper due,’” says debate fellow and senior Isaac Lock. “With the Civil Discourse Project, students are thinking about big ideas, maybe not having super-strong, solid opinions, but they’re at least considering them in ways that they probably haven’t done before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;They’re also learning what a balanced conversation feels like. The student debates use a format developed by Braver Angels, a national organization that holds workshops and debates to try to bridge the partisan divide that exists in the United States today. With strict time limits and room for both prepared speeches and spontaneous remarks, the format “allows different types of people to speak,” says debate fellow Arianna Doss, a sophomore. “Because of the debates, we're better-equipped to articulate our points and provide nuance — why I believe what I believe — while also acknowledging and understanding the shortcomings of our arguments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Civil Discourse Project will publish more about its spring semester lectures &lt;a href="https://civildiscourse.mit.edu/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;. Coleman Hughes, author of “The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America,” will be on campus March 3, and a debate on the relevance of legacy media is being planned for later in the semester.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Used to be, societies would recycle building materials. In Rome, St. Peter’s Basilica was made from the stones of the Colosseum. The Inca reused stones from one project to the next. Today we rarely do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MIT associate professor of architecture Brandon Clifford observes, we barely even admit how often we tear down buildings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The architect today designs a building with the false presumption that it’s going to last forever,” Clifford says. “Unfortunately the reality is, some buildings last the length of our mortgages, 30 years. Then they go to landfills.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “If an archaeologist looks back at our time, we will be called the mound builders because we’re making enormous landfills all around the world. Those are the things that are going to last. Civilizations will ask, “What were people thinking in the early 2000s, when they were just building these colossal mounds?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back in time imaginatively is Clifford’s job: He studies ancient structures and building practices, to generate new ones. Recently Clifford’s studio, Matter Design, took discarded concrete chunks — from a dairy barn floor, a Motel 6 wall, and a roadbed — and used digital design and modern cutting tools to assemble them into a new wall. If the ancients could redeploy materials, why can’t we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans have been reassembling random bits of material from previous incarnations of architecture for millennia, but we just don’t understand the rules today,” says Clifford, who has also designed buildings, written a manifesto about learning from the past, and had his students build a megalithic stone and move it around Killian Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ve assembled more bits of material about Clifford himself, fitted them together, and built this profile article to last — for a while, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage the talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually all architectural work contains a critique of other building forms. Clifford is upfront about this: Construction today is unsustainable, inefficient, and costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current mode of designing and subsequent construction is not working,” Clifford wrote in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint, the architectural designs Clifford has produced — like competition entries for the Bamiyan Cultural Center in Afghanistan and the Guggenheim Helsinki — are sensitive to the supply of materials. An award-winning small project of Clifford’s, the Five Fields Play Structure in suburban Massachusetts, cleverly maximizes its square footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Clifford’s career is not really about one style of architecture. It’s about one style of architectural thinking. Today we seem surprised at the architecture of the ancients, but to Clifford, that just means we haven’t thought creatively enough about how they solved problems. Ultimately, Clifford wants to leverage the talent around him to rework our building habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our lab we find work to be successful if it challenges the way you think about the broader discipline,” says Clifford, who was granted tenure at MIT this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space odyssey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford’s father was an astronaut. Rich Clifford served in the military, joined NASA, and flew on three space shuttle missions in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I grew up in Houston, surrounded by the space industry,” Clifford says. He lived down the street from astronaut John Young — one of the 12 people to walk on the moon and co-pilot of the first space shuttle flight, in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich Clifford was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease before his last shuttle flight. He died in late 2021. Brandon Clifford has been reflecting about his father’s trajectory, and its influence on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I work with prehistoric, gravity-laden, human contributions to Earth, while my dad was exploring space,” he says. “But we’re both exploring things, in very different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some ways, NASA reminds Clifford of his current employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NASA is such an interesting cross-pollination of ideas,” Clifford observes. “It’s balanced between the military and public-facing images of space. The space industry has always been generating challenging ideas about humanity, while also being very scientifically rigorous. I see MIT as being on equal footing with NASA in that respect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stones and civilization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford graduated from Georgia Tech in 2006, studying architecture with a focus on digital fabrication. He went to graduate school at Princeton University while the housing market crashed. “Every single one of my classmates was losing their job in architecture,” Clifford recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In graduate school, he was studying digital fabrication again. Then one day, MIT architectural historian Mark Jarzombek arrived in Princeton for a lecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said you can tell a civilization is doing well, if it is carving stone precisely,” Clifford says. “That moment shifted my career, and since then I have been studying stone architecture.” By the way, we don’t do much stone carving today, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford started thinking historically and globally. One common narrative is that architecture emerged out of making shelters. Yet, from Egypt to Easter Island, many societies have often advanced their building techniques for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at prehistory, the pyramids, Stonehenge, the moai of Easter Island, the polygonal masonry structure of the Inca, none of them are shelter,” Clifford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging into these structures reveals how societies maximized what they had. When the Inca recycled stone blocks into walls, they would only cut the top side, to fit each block into the new structure. The Greeks would cut the bottom side. But both were optimizing their resources and labor. Ancient practices contain useful ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you don’t know can help you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, we don’t know everything about ancient buildings. To Clifford, this is a feature, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After all, if there are mysteries about the architecture of the past, there is room for us to think creatively about it. Given 12 hypotheses about how Stonehenge was constructed, 11 may be historically inaccurate — but several of those might contain interesting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My work is often misunderstood as experimental archaeology,” Clifford says. “But as an architect I’m interested in the future. I’m not trying to prove anything about the past. I’m just trying to extract bits of knowledge or find alternative ways of thinking about past construction that can change the way we think about the future. If any theory changes the way we do something, it’s still useful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a megalith move&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When outsiders reached Easter Island in 1722, an obvious mystery was how the island’s gigantic statues were transported around. The islanders claimed the moai&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;had “walked” to their locations, which sounded like a fanciful myth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 2011, archaeologists Terry Hunt and Carl Lipo proposed that the Easter Island statues had been transported upright, with people using ropes to sway the statues side to side while pivoting them forward. Thus the statues could have “walked,” although not everyone immediately accepted the hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford, who landed at MIT in 2012, co-taught a class with Jarzombek in 2015 that featured a group project: The students built a 16-foot megalith out of glass fiber reinforced concrete, then figured out how to transport it around Killian Court with ropes. They named it the McKnelly Megalith. The course had a teaching assistant, Carrie Lee McKnelly, whose parents had just tragically passed away, so the name was in their honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key to the McKnelly Megalith’s mobility was its curving shape. Because the center of gravity is not in the middle of the structure’s form, it is easier to pivot and swivel around. The Easter Island moai use this design principle too. The MIT class was not the first test of moving a megalith with rope — Hunt and Lipo did that in Hawaii — but it did reinforce the method’s viability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the kind of thing that’s celebrated in MIT culture, honestly,” Clifford says. “Let’s make a big megalith move.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And float&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Clifford and his students doubled down on megaliths, with the &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/scene-at-mit-buoy-stone-0621"&gt;Buoy Stone&lt;/a&gt;, a huge, pear-shaped, fiber-reinforced piece of concrete they moored in the Charles River outside of Killian Court for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buoy Stone was built for MIT’s “&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/crossing-charles-moving-day-parade-competition-0509"&gt;Moving Day&lt;/a&gt;,” a celebration of its 100th anniversary of relocating from Boston across the rover to Cambridge. The stone was an exploration of transporting megaliths on water — as many of Stonehenge’s pieces were. In this case, the Buoy Stone was towed on water horizontally, and then when stationary, it partially filled with water and tipped upright. The object also caused a lot of local head-scratching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford again: “We had no title saying what the Buoy Stone was. With megaliths, that’s part of the mystery: Why is that thing here? A giant stone miles from the nearest quarry is an intriguing artifact. People in Cambridge still tell me, ‘I run along the Charles River and I used to wonder what that weird thing was.’ It was a fun project because it was a celebration of MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Buoy Stone didn’t address a historical debate as directly as the McKnelly Megalith had, but it may have contemporary applications, perhaps in barrier-type structures, and was an exercise in creative design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At MIT, the students are very open and accepting of challenging ideas,” Clifford says. “They want to think differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colossus and the cosmos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clifford is hardly the only MIT faculty member who studies ancient building techniques; others include Jarzombek, John Ochsendorf, Admir Masic, and more. But he has settled into his own niche in the area, and is currently working on a new book project about his explorations, tentatively titled “Colossus and the Cosmos.” He has given a TED Talk and won the American Academy in Rome Prize, among other honors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be Clifford’s second book. His first was his quirky 2017 volume, “The Cannibal’s Cookbook,” with the “Cannibal” term alluding to recycling building materials, while the “Cookbook” part refers to the idea that there are recipes for doing this.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there already exist advocates for “circular construction,” the greater reuse of building materials, Clifford thinks the concept needs greater circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way architecture is set up now doesn’t allow for that,” Clifford says. “We don’t have a way of reincorporating materials. Much of the reception to the first book has been from students of architecture, exploring design. I’m hoping the next layer of impact will be with the building industry, finding ways of automating this process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creative company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenure can free up professors to pursue independent-minded projects, although Clifford, for one, has never needed much encouragement in that regard. One nuance of Clifford’s career, though, is that while he has pursued his own path, it has involved a lot of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have the best colleagues I could imagine, and I think of my MIT graduate students as colleagues as well,” Clifford says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds: “I’ve never done a project on my own. I had this idea, before I started studying architecture, that an architect just sat at a drafting table and conceived of buildings, the solitary genius thing. But every project I’ve done is a collaboration with someone that knows something different. I realize there’s so much I don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s that notion again, that the gaps in our knowledge are an opportunity. We will never know it all about old buildings, but even so, as Clifford notes: “The question is, ‘How much do you need to know about something to change the way you think about the future?’ That’s where the value is.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inventive solutions to some of the world’s most critical problems are being discovered in labs, classrooms, and centers across MIT every day. Many of these solutions move from the lab to the commercial world with the help of over 85 Institute resources that comprise MIT’s robust innovation and entrepreneurship (I&amp;amp;E) ecosystem. The Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) draws on MIT’s wealth of I&amp;amp;E knowledge and experience to help researchers commercialize their breakthrough technologies through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions grant program&lt;/a&gt;. By collaborating with I&amp;amp;E programs on campus, J-WAFS prepares MIT researchers for the commercial world, where their novel innovations aim to improve productivity, accessibility, and sustainability of water and food systems, creating economic, environmental, and societal benefits along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The J-WAFS Solutions program launched in 2015 with support from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.communityjameel.org/"&gt;Community Jameel&lt;/a&gt;, an international organization that advances science and learning for communities to thrive. Since 2015, J-WAFS Solutions has supported 19 projects with one-year grants of up to $150,000, with some projects receiving renewal grants for a second year of support. Solutions projects all address challenges related to water or food. Modeled after the esteemed grant program of MIT’s Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation, and initially administered by Deshpande Center staff, the J-WAFS Solutions program follows a similar approach by supporting projects that have already completed the basic research and proof-of-concept phases.&amp;nbsp;With technologies that are one to three years away from commercialization, grantees work on identifying their potential markets and learn to focus on how their technology can meet the needs of future customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ingenuity thrives at MIT, driving inventions that can be translated into real-world applications for widespread adoption, implantation, and use,” says J-WAFS Director Professor John H. Lienhard V. “But successful commercialization of MIT technology requires engineers to focus on many challenges beyond making the technology work. MIT’s I&amp;amp;E network offers a variety of programs that help researchers develop technology readiness, investigate markets, conduct customer discovery, and initiate product design and development,” Lienhard adds.&amp;nbsp;“With this strong I&amp;amp;E framework, many J-WAFS Solutions teams have established startup companies by the completion of the grant.&amp;nbsp;J-WAFS-supported technologies have had powerful, positive effects on human welfare. Together, the J-WAFS Solutions program and MIT’s I&amp;amp;E ecosystem demonstrate how academic research can evolve into business innovations that make a better world,” Lienhard says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating I&amp;amp;E collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to support for furthering research, J-WAFS Solutions grants allow faculty, students, postdocs, and research staff to learn the fundamentals of how to transform their work into commercial products and companies. As part of the grant requirements, researchers must interact with mentors through MIT Venture Mentoring Service (VMS). VMS connects MIT entrepreneurs with teams of carefully selected professionals who provide free and confidential mentorship, guidance, and other services to help advance ideas into for-profit, for-benefit, or nonprofit ventures. Since 2000, VMS has mentored over 4,600 MIT entrepreneurs across all industries, through a dynamic and accomplished group of nearly 200 mentors who volunteer their time so that others may succeed. The mentors provide impartial and unbiased advice to members of the MIT community, including MIT alumni in the Boston area. J-WAFS Solutions teams have been guided by 21 mentors from numerous companies and nonprofits. Mentors often attend project events and progress meetings throughout the grant period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working with VMS has provided me and my organization with a valuable sounding board for a range of topics, big and small,” says Eric Verploegen PhD ’08, former research engineer in the MIT D-Lab and founder of J-WAFS spinout &lt;a href="https://www.coolveg.org/"&gt;CoolVeg&lt;/a&gt;. Along with professors Leon Glicksman and Daniel Frey, Verploegen received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021 to commercialize cold-storage chambers that use evaporative cooling to help farmers preserve fruits and vegetables in rural off-grid communities. Verploegen started CoolVeg in 2022 to increase access and adoption of open-source, evaporative cooling technologies through collaborations with businesses, research institutions, nongovernmental organizations, and government agencies. “Working as a solo founder at my nonprofit venture, it is always great to have avenues to get feedback on communications approaches, overall strategy, and operational issues that my mentors have experience with,” Verploegen says. Three years after the initial Solutions grant, one of the VMS mentors assigned to the evaporative cooling team still acts as a mentor to Verploegen today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Solutions grant requirement is for teams to participate in the Spark program — a free, three-week course that provides an entry point for researchers to explore the potential value of their innovation. Spark is part of the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps), which is an “immersive, entrepreneurial training program that facilitates the transformation of invention to impact.” In 2018, MIT received an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2018/mit-selected-ninth-nsf-innovation-corps-node-new-england-0904"&gt;award&lt;/a&gt; from the NSF, establishing the New England Regional Innovation Corps Node (NE I-Corps) to deliver I-Corps training to participants across New England. Trainings are open to researchers, engineers, scientists, and others who want to engage in a customer discovery process for their technology. Offered regularly throughout the year, the Spark course helps participants identify markets and explore customer needs in order to understand how their technologies can be positioned competitively in their target markets. They learn to assess barriers to adoption, as well as potential regulatory issues or other challenges to commercialization. NE-I-Corps reports that since its start, over 1,200 researchers from MIT have completed the program and have gone on to launch 175 ventures, raising over $3.3 billion in funding from grants and investors, and creating over 1,800 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantinos Katsimpouras, a research scientist in the Department of Chemical Engineering, went through the NE I-Corps Spark program to better understand the customer base for a technology he developed with&amp;nbsp;professors Gregory Stephanopoulos and Anthony Sinskey.&amp;nbsp;The group received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2021&amp;nbsp;for their microbial platform that converts food waste from the dairy industry into valuable products.&amp;nbsp;“As a scientist with no prior experience in entrepreneurship, the program introduced me to important concepts and tools for conducting customer interviews and adopting a new mindset,” notes Katsimpouras. “Most importantly, it encouraged me to get out of the building and engage in interviews with potential customers and stakeholders, providing me with invaluable insights and a deeper understanding of my industry,” he adds. These interviews also helped connect the team with companies willing to provide resources to test and improve their technology — a critical step to the scale-up of any lab invention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of Professor Cem Tasan’s research group in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, the I-Corps program led them to the J-WAFS Solutions grant, instead of the other way around. Tasan is currently working with postdoc Onur Guvenc on a J-WAFS Solutions project to manufacture formable sheet metal by consolidating steel scrap without melting, thereby reducing water use compared to traditional steel processing. Before applying for the Solutions grant, Guvenc took part in NE I-Corps. Like Katsimpouras, Guvenc benefited from the interaction with industry. “This program required me to step out of the lab and engage with potential customers, allowing me to learn about their immediate challenges and test my initial assumptions about the market,” Guvenc recalls. “My interviews with industry professionals also made me aware of the connection between water consumption and steelmaking processes, which ultimately led to the J-WAFS 2023 Solutions Grant,” says Guvenc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing the Spark program, participants may be eligible to apply for the Fusion program, which provides microgrants of up to $1,500 to conduct further customer discovery. The Fusion program is self-paced, requiring teams to conduct 12 additional customer interviews and craft a final presentation summarizing their key learnings. Professor Patrick Doyle’s J-WAFS Solutions team completed the Spark and Fusion programs at MIT. Most recently, their team was accepted to join the NSF I-Corps National program with a $50,000 award. The intensive program requires teams to complete an additional 100 customer discovery interviews over seven weeks. Located in the Department of Chemical Engineering, the Doyle lab is working on a sustainable microparticle hydrogel system to rapidly remove micropollutants from water. The team’s focus has expanded to higher value purifications in amino acid and biopharmaceutical manufacturing applications. Devashish Gokhale PhD ’24 worked with Doyle on much of the underlying science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our platform technology could potentially be used for selective separations in very diverse market segments, ranging from individual consumers to large industries and government bodies with varied use-cases,” Gokhale explains. He goes on to say, “The I-Corps Spark program added significant value by providing me with an effective framework to approach this problem ... I was assigned a mentor who provided critical feedback, teaching me how to formulate effective questions and identify promising opportunities.” Gokhale says that by the end of Spark, the team was able to identify the best target markets for their products. He also says that the program provided valuable seminars on topics like intellectual property, which was helpful in subsequent discussions the team had with MIT’s Technology Licensing Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another member of Doyle’s team, Arjav Shah, a recent PhD from MIT’s Department of Chemical Engineering and a current MBA candidate at the MIT Sloan School of Management, is spearheading the team’s commercialization plans. Shah attended Fusion last fall and hopes to lead efforts to incorporate a startup company called hydroGel.&amp;nbsp; “I admire the hypothesis-driven approach of the I-Corps program,” says Shah. “It has enabled us to identify our customers’ biggest pain points, which will hopefully lead us to finding a product-market fit.” He adds “based on our learnings from the program, we have been able to pivot to impact-driven, higher-value applications in the food processing and biopharmaceutical industries.” Postdoc Luca Mazzaferro will lead the technical team at hydroGel alongside Shah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a different project, Qinmin Zheng, a postdoc in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, is working with Professor Andrew Whittle and Lecturer Fábio Duarte. Zheng plans to take the Fusion course this fall to advance their J-WAFS Solutions project that aims to commercialize a novel sensor to quantify the relative abundance of major algal species and provide early detection of harmful algal blooms. After completing Spark, Zheng says he’s “excited to participate in the Fusion program, and potentially the National I-Corps program, to further explore market opportunities and minimize risks in our future product development.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic and societal benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercializing technologies developed at MIT is one of the ways J-WAFS helps ensure that MIT research advances will have real-world impacts in water and food systems. Since its inception, the J-WAFS Solutions program has awarded 28 grants (including renewals), which have supported 19 projects that address a wide range of global water and food challenges. The program has distributed over $4 million to 24 professors, 11 research staff, 15 postdocs, and 30 students across MIT. Nearly half of all J-WAFS Solutions projects have resulted in spinout companies or commercialized products, including eight companies to date plus two open-source technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nona-technologies.com/"&gt;Nona Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a J-WAFS spinout that is helping the world by developing new approaches to produce freshwater for drinking. Desalination — the process of removing salts from seawater — typically requires a large-scale technology called reverse osmosis. But Nona created a desalination device that can work in remote off-grid locations.&amp;nbsp;By separating salt and bacteria from water using electric current through a process called ion concentration polarization (ICP), their technology also reduces overall energy consumption. The novel method was developed by Jongyoon Han, professor of electrical engineering and biological engineering, and research scientist Junghyo Yoon. Along with Bruce Crawford, a Sloan MBA alum, Han and Yoon created Nona Technologies to bring their lightweight, energy-efficient desalination technology to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My feeling early on was that once you have technology, commercialization will take care of itself,” admits Crawford. The team completed both the Spark and Fusion programs and quickly realized that much more work would be required. “Even in our first 24 interviews, we learned that the two first markets we envisioned would not be viable in the near term, and we also got our first hints at the beachhead we ultimately selected,” says Crawford. Nona Technologies has since won MIT’s $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, received media attention from outlets like &lt;em&gt;Newsweek &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, and hired a team that continues to further the technology for deployment in resource-limited areas where clean drinking water may be scarce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food-borne diseases sicken millions of people worldwide each year, but J-WAFS researchers are addressing this issue by integrating molecular engineering, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence to revolutionize food pathogen testing. Professors Tim Swager and Alexander Klibanov, of the Department of Chemistry, were awarded one of the first J-WAFS Solutions grants for their sensor that targets food safety pathogens. The sensor uses specialized droplets that behave like a dynamic lens, changing in the presence of target bacteria in order to detect dangerous bacterial contamination in food. In 2018, Swager launched &lt;a href="https://www.xibus.systems/"&gt;Xibus Systems Inc.&lt;/a&gt; to bring the sensor to market and advance food safety for greater public health, sustainability, and economic security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our involvement with the J-WAFS Solutions Program has been vital,” says Swager. “It has provided us with a bridge between the academic world and the business world and allowed us to perform more detailed work to create a usable application,” he adds. In 2022, Xibus developed a product called XiSafe, which enables the detection of contaminants like salmonella and listeria faster and with higher sensitivity than other food testing products. The innovation could save food processors billions of dollars worldwide and prevent thousands of food-borne fatalities annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS Solutions companies have raised nearly $66 million in venture capital and other funding. Just this past June, J-WAFS spinout SiTration announced that it raised an $11.8 million seed round. Jeffrey Grossman, a professor in MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering, was another early J-WAFS Solutions grantee for his work on low-cost energy-efficient filters for desalination. The project enabled the development of nanoporous membranes and resulted in two spinout companies, &lt;a href="https://viaseparations.com/"&gt;Via Separations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sitration.com/"&gt;SiTration&lt;/a&gt;. SiTration was co-founded by Brendan Smith PhD ’18, who was a part of the original J-WAFS team. Smith is CEO of the company and has overseen the advancement of the membrane technology, which has gone on to reduce cost and resource consumption in industrial wastewater treatment, advanced manufacturing, and resource extraction of materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from recycled electric vehicle batteries. The company also recently announced that it is working with the mining company Rio Tinto to handle harmful wastewater generated at mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not just J-WAFS spinout companies that are producing real-world results. Products like the ECC Vial — a portable, low-cost method for &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; detection in water — have been brought to the market and helped thousands of people. The test kit was developed by MIT D-Lab Lecturer Susan Murcott and Professor Jeffrey Ravel of the MIT History Section. The duo received a J-WAFS Solutions grant in 2018 to promote safely managed drinking water and improved public health in Nepal, where it is difficult to identify which wells are contaminated by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. By the end of their grant period, the team had manufactured approximately 3,200 units, of which 2,350 were distributed — enough to help 12,000 people in Nepal. The researchers also trained local Nepalese on best manufacturing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important, in my life experience, to follow your dream and to serve others,” says Murcott. Economic success is important to the health of any venture, whether it’s a company or a product, but equally important is the social impact — a philosophy that J-WAFS research strives to uphold. “Do something because it’s worth doing and because it changes people’s lives and saves lives,” Murcott adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As J-WAFS prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary this year, we look forward to continued collaboration with MIT’s many I&amp;amp;E programs to advance knowledge and develop solutions that will have tangible effects on the world’s water and food systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the &lt;a href="https://jwafs.mit.edu/SolutionsGrants"&gt;J-WAFS Solutions program&lt;/a&gt; and about &lt;a href="https://facts.mit.edu/entrepreneurship-innovation/"&gt;innovation and entrepreneurship at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;A new, multidisciplinary MIT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://musictech.mit.edu/mtcgp"&gt;graduate program in music technology and computation&lt;/a&gt; will feature faculty, labs, and curricula from across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program is a collaboration between the &lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Music and Theater Arts Section&lt;/a&gt; in the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS) and the &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;School of Engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Faculty for the program share appointments between the Music and Theater Arts Section, the &lt;a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu" target="_blank"&gt;Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; (EECS), and the &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The launch of a new graduate program in music technology strikes me as both a necessary and a&amp;nbsp;provocative gesture — an important leap in an era being rapidly redefined by exponential growth in computation, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interactions of every conceivable kind,”&amp;nbsp;says&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/jay-scheib" target="_blank"&gt;Jay Scheib&lt;/a&gt;,​​ head of the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section and the Class of 1949 Professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Music plays an elegant role at the fore of a remarkable convergence of art and technology,” adds Scheib. “It’s the right time to launch this program and if not at MIT, then where?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s practitioners define music technology as the field of scientific inquiry where they study, discover, and develop new computational approaches to music that include music information retrieval; artificial intelligence; machine learning; generative algorithms; interaction and performance systems; digital instrument design; conceptual and perceptual modeling of music; acoustics; audio signal processing; and software development for creative expression and music applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/eran-egozy" target="_blank"&gt;Eran Egozy&lt;/a&gt;, professor of the practice in music technology and one of the program leads, says MIT’s focus is technical research in music technology that always centers the humanistic and artistic aspects of making music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There are so many MIT students who are fabulous musicians,” says Egozy. “We'll approach music technology as computer scientists, mathematicians, and musicians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;With the launch of this new program — an offering alongside those available in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/?filter=everything&amp;amp;tag=music"&gt;Media Lab&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere — Egozy sees MIT becoming the obvious destination for students interested in music and computation study, preparing high-impact graduates for roles in academia and industry, while also helping mold creative, big-picture thinkers who can tackle large challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigating big ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The program will encompass two master’s degrees and a PhD:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The Master of Science (MS) is a two-semester, thesis-based program available only to MIT undergraduates. One semester of fellowship is automatically awarded to all admitted students. The first class will enroll in fall 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The Master of Applied Science (MAS) is a two-semester, coursework-based program available to all students. One semester of fellowship funding is automatically awarded to all admitted students. Applications for this program will open in fall 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;The PhD program is available to all students, who would apply to MIT’s School of Engineering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/person/anna-huang" target="_blank"&gt;Anna Huang&lt;/a&gt;, a new MIT assistant professor who holds a shared faculty position between the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section and the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, is collaborating with Egozy to develop and launch the program. Huang arrived at MIT this fall after spending eight years with Magenta at Google Brain and DeepMind, spearheading efforts in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction to support human-AI partnerships in music-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“As a composer turned AI researcher who specializes in generative music technology, my long-term goal is to develop AI systems that can shed new light on how we understand, learn, and create music, and to learn from interactions between musicians in order to transform how we approach human-AI collaboration,” says Huang. “This new program will let us further investigate how musical applications can illuminate problems in understanding neural networks, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s new &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-keeril-makan-new-mit-music-building-0109"&gt;Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building&lt;/a&gt;, featuring&amp;nbsp;enhanced music technology spaces, will also help transform music education with versatile performance venues and optimized rehearsal facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A natural home for music technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT’s world-class, top-ranked engineering program, combined with its focus on computation and its conservatory-level music education offerings, makes the Institute a natural home for the continued expansion of music technology education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The collaborative nature of the new program is the latest example of interdisciplinary work happening across the Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“I am thrilled that the School of Engineering is partnering with the MIT Music and Theater Arts Section on this important initiative, which represents the convergence of various engineering areas — such as AI and design — with music,” says &lt;a href="https://engineering.mit.edu/about/leadership/anantha-p-chandrakasan/" target="_blank"&gt;Anantha Chandrakasan&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the School of Engineering, chief innovation and strategy officer, and the Vannevar Bush Professor of EECS. “I can’t wait to see the innovative projects the students will create and how they will drive this new field forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Everyone on campus knows that MIT is a great place to do music. But I want people to come to MIT because of what we do in music,” says &lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/rayo/" target="_blank"&gt;Agustin Rayo&lt;/a&gt;, the Kenan Sahin Dean of SHASS. “This outstanding collaboration with the Schwarzman College of Computing and the School of Engineering will make that dream a reality, by bringing together the world’s best engineers with our extraordinary musicians to create the next generation of music technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The new master’s program offers students an unparalleled opportunity to explore the intersection of music and technology,” says &lt;a href="https://computing.mit.edu/daniel-huttenlocher/" target="_blank"&gt;Daniel Huttenlocher&lt;/a&gt;, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of EECS. “It equips them with a deep understanding of this confluence, preparing them to advance new approaches to computational models of music and be at the forefront of an evolving area.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Protecting the rights of internet users, in Mexico and worldwide</title>

        <dc:creator>Austin Chen | MIT News correspondent</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement, a single Tweet or Facebook post was able to mobilize thousands in a matter of hours. In 2012, protests came to the streets of Mexico as young people demonstrated against the results of the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent college graduate of the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mariel García-Montes had classmates who were nonviolently participating in the protests. One was arrested and jailed, and as García-Montes pored over online surveillance videos and photos to help free her, she was struck by the power of the tools at her disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Videos and maps and photographs placed her at a different location at the time that her arraignment said,” García-Montes says. “When she was able to walk out of jail partly because of technological evidence, I thought, ‘Maybe this is a window of opportunity to use technology for social good.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a decade later, García-Montes is still looking for more of those windows. She first came to MIT in 2016 to pursue a master’s degree in comparative media studies and is currently working with Professor Eden Medina on a&amp;nbsp;PhD thesis in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society, which will chart the history of technology’s influence on surveillance and privacy, particularly in her home country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would love for my work, theoretical and practical, to build into these global movements for necessary and proportionate surveillance,” she says. “It needs to have counterweights and limits, and it needs to be really thought through to preserve people’s privacy and other rights, not just security.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More broadly,” she continues, “I would love to be part of a generation thinking about what technology would look like if we put the public interest first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing up alongside the internet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;García-Montes has been thinking about justice and the public for much of her life, thanks in large part to her mother, who taught philosophy at the university level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was the ultimate professor for me,” she says. “She provided me with a moral compass and intellectual curiosity, and I’m grateful I get to live her dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother was also instrumental in piquing her interest in the internet. As a professor, she had access to the internet at a time when few Mexicans did, and set García-Montes up with an email account and allowed her to use the computer at the university when she was a child.&amp;nbsp;The experience was formative, as she noticed the “vast difference” between those who had access and those who did not. For example, she recalls learning online about a devastating tsunami in Asia, while none of her peers had any idea that it was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time passed and more and more people did gain internet access, the online landscape changed, particularly for young people. García-Montes quickly realized that someone needed to take responsibility for keeping those young people safe and internet-literate, and she worked with a number of organizations that did just that, such as UNICEF and Global Changemakers. The issues have only compounded since then, but she isn’t letting up either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no silver bullet,” she says. “We need to rethink the entire ecosystem. We cannot put it on parents to teach their kids. We cannot put it on teachers. We cannot put it on online users. Instead of only centering profit and only centering page views or engagement, we need to also center pro-social behavior and the public interest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised by women — her mom, her aunt, her cousin, and her grandmother —&amp;nbsp;García-Montes&amp;nbsp;incorporates the feminist ideals of her upbringing into her academic work&amp;nbsp;wherever she can. In 2022, she helped write a paper with MIT associate professor of urban science and planning Catherine D’Ignazio that examined the ways activists around the world are trying to address the deficiencies in government data on gender-related violence against women. The data are often absent or incomplete, so she and her co-authors highlighted the vital work being done to fill in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“​​When Catherine started to work with feminicide data activists, I knew a bunch of them because I had worked with them previously,” she says. “I thought, ‘Oh, my goodness, the day has finally come that these people can have the prominence that they’ve long deserved.’ The hours of work that they put in and the emotional toll it takes on them is just outstanding, and they weren’t really getting the recognition for that labor and their technical expertise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her dissertation is a study of the history of surveillance technologies in Mexico. Specifically, she is looking at the ways contemporary debates on information technologies, such as spyware and facial recognition, interact with existing governance and infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of privacy and community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her thesis research has instilled in García-Montes a deep concern for where things are headed for the average citizen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Different types of data collection continue to be developed because of the data broker industry,” she says. “Your power bill can be an instrument of surveillance, and facial recognition has been appearing in airports. The forms of data collection are becoming much more nuanced, much more pervasive, and much harder to evade.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pervasiveness has led to a general acceptance among the population, she says, but she’s also encouraged by the advocacy groups that have continued to fight on. She agrees with those groups that it should not be left to individuals to protect their own data, and that ultimately, there needs to be a legislative and cultural environment that values the preservation of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The awareness of fights that have been won is rising,” she says.&amp;nbsp;“The awareness of the loss of privacy is also rising, and so I don’t think that it’s going to be a clear win for privacy-violating companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While her studies at MIT fill most of her time, García-Montes also finds purpose participating in community life in her Greater-Boston neighborhood. During the coronavirus pandemic, García-Montes and her neighbors forged bonds as they provided mutual aid for the essential workers and vulnerable people of their neighborhood. The camaraderie they developed persists today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether online or in real life, “There is joy in community,” she says. “At the root of it, I want to be around people. I want to know my neighbors, and&amp;nbsp;being able to use technology to solve some of our mutual aid needs&amp;nbsp;helps me feel good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2024, eight faculty were granted tenure in the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. They include the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://sts-program.mit.edu/people/sts-faculty/dwai-banerjee/"&gt;Dwaipayan Banerjee&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. His work foregrounds the intellectual labor of South Asian scientists, engineers and medical practitioners, challenging conventional understandings of science, technology, and medicine. Banerjee has published two books, “Enduring Cancer” and “Hematologies,” with a third, “Computing in the Time of Decolonization,” under review at Princeton University Press. His research spans the politics of health, pandemics, and computing, all through a lens that critically examines global inequalities in scientific and technological practice. Drawing upon his research, Banerjee's teaching philosophy emphasizes global perspectives and interdisciplinary inquiry, with courses like STS.012&amp;nbsp;(Science in Action) and 21A.504J/STS.086J/WGS.276J (Cultures of Computing) being highly popular at MIT. He has also played a pivotal role in various editorial boards, MIT committees, and advising PhD students, further solidifying his impact on both the academic and global community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/people/faculty/dorst/"&gt;Kevin Dorst&lt;/a&gt; PhD ‘19 is an associate professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. He works at the border between philosophy and the behavioral sciences, combining mathematical, computational, and empirical methods to study the causes of bias and polarization — and argues that people are more rational than you’d think. He earned his PhD from MIT in 2019, and then was a junior research fellow at Magdalen College at Oxford University and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, before returning to MIT in 2022.&amp;nbsp;He currently holds a visiting Humboldt Research Fellowship at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/paloma-duong/"&gt;Paloma Duong &lt;/a&gt;is an associate professor in MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing. At the intersection of cultural studies, media theory, and critical theory, she researches and teaches modern and contemporary Latin American culture. She works with social texts and emergent media cultures that speak to the exercise of cultural agencies and the formation of political subjectivity. Her most recent book is “Portable Postsocialisms: Cuban Mediascapes after the End of History,” a study of Cuba’s changing mediascape and an inquiry on the postsocialist condition and its contexts. Her articles have been published in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Art Margins&lt;/em&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cuban Counterpoints: Public Scholarship about a Changing Cuba&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/amy-moran-thomas"&gt;Amy Moran-Thomas&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in MIT Anthropology. Her ethnographic research focuses on how health technologies and ecologies are designed and come to be materially embodied — often inequitably — by people in their ordinary lives. She received her PhD in Anthropology from Princeton University in 2012. Her first book, “Traveling with Sugar: Chronicles of a Global Epidemic (University of California Press, 2019),” offers an anthropological account of diabetes care technologies in use and the lives they shape in global perspective. The book received an award from the caregivers in Belize whose work it describes, alongside others. In 2024-26, she is co-leading a climate and health humanities project funded by an ACLS Digital Seed Grant, “Sugar Atlas: Counter-Mapping Diabetes from the Caribbean,” together with co-PIs Tonya Haynes and Nicole Charles. Also working on a book about embodied histories of energy, Moran-Thomas is interested in how social perspectives on design can contribute to producing fairer health technologies. More broadly, her research explores the material culture of chronic conditions; embodied aspects of planetary health; intergenerational dilemmas of responsibility; and writing public anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/justin-reich/"&gt;Justin Reich&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing. He is an educational researcher interested in the future of learning in a networked world. He is the director of the MIT Teaching Systems Lab, which aspires to design, implement and research the future of teacher learning. He is the author of “Iterate: The Secret to Innovation in Schools” and “Failure to Disrupt: Why Technology Alone Can't Transform Education” from Harvard University Press. He is the host of the TeachLab podcast, and five open online courses on EdX including 0.504x (Sorting Truth from Fiction: Civic Online Reasoning) and 0.503x (Becoming a More Equitable Educator: Mindsets and Practices). He is a former fellow and faculty associate of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://anthropology.mit.edu/people/faculty/bettina-stoetzer"&gt;Bettina Stoetzer&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in MIT Anthropology. She is a cultural anthropologist whose research focuses on the intersections of ecology, globalization, and social justice in Europe and the U.S. Bettina’s award-winning book, “Ruderal City: Ecologies of Migration, Race, and Urban Nature in Berlin&amp;nbsp;(Duke University Press, 2022),” draws on fieldwork with immigrant and refugee communities, as well as ecologists, nature enthusiasts and other Berlin residents to illustrate how human-environment relations become a key register through which urban citizenship is articulated in Europe. She is also the author of a 2004 book on feminism and anti-racism, "InDifferenzen: Feministische Theorie in der Antirassistischen Kritik" (“InDifferences: Feminist Theory in Antiracist Criticism,&amp;nbsp;argument"). She co-edited “Shock and Awe: War on Words” with Bregje van Eekelen, Jennifer Gonzalez, and Anna Tsing&amp;nbsp;(New Pacific Press, 2004). She is currently working on a new project on wildlife mobility, climate change, and border politics in the U.S. and Germany. At MIT, she teaches classes on cities, race and migration, environmental justice, gender, and climate change. She received her MA in sociology, anthropology and media studies from the University of Goettingen and completed her PhD in anthropology at the University of California at Santa Cruz in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/ariel-white"&gt;Ariel White&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science. She studies voting and voting rights, race, the criminal legal system, and bureaucratic behavior. Her research uses large datasets to measure individual-level experiences, and to shed light on people's everyday interactions with government. Her recent work investigates how potential voters react to experiences with punitive government policies, such as incarceration and immigration enforcement, and how people can make their way back into political life after these experiences. In other projects, she and her co-authors have examined how local election officials treat constituents of different ethnicities, how media shapes public conversations, and whether parties face electoral penalties when nominating minority candidates. Her research has appeared in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;American Political Science Review&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Politics&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://polisci.mit.edu/people/bernardo-zacka"&gt;Bernardo Zacka&lt;/a&gt; is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science. He is a political theorist with an interest in ethnographic methods. His research focuses on how the state is experienced by those who interact with it and those who act in its name. His first book, “When the State Meets the Street (Harvard University Press, 2017),”&amp;nbsp;probes the everyday moral life of street-level bureaucrats. His second book project, “Institutional Atmospherics,” looks at several episodes in the 20th century when welfare agencies turned to architecture and interior design to try to repair their relationship to citizens, and recovers from that history a more ambitious conception of what an interface between state and society can and should do. He received his PhD from the Department of Government at Harvard University. He has been a fellow of the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin and is currently on sabbatical at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Legal documents are notoriously difficult to understand, even for lawyers. This raises the question: Why are these documents written in a style that makes them so impenetrable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT cognitive scientists believe they have uncovered the answer to that question. Just as “magic spells” use special rhymes and archaic terms to signal their power, the convoluted language of legalese acts to convey a sense of authority, they conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study appearing this week in the journal of the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers found that even non-lawyers use this type of language when asked to write laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People seem to understand that there’s an implicit rule that this is how laws should sound, and they write them that way,” says Edward Gibson, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Martinez PhD ’24 is the lead author of the study. Francis Mollica, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne, is also an author of the &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2405564121" target="_blank"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casting a legal spell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson’s research group has been studying the unique characteristics of legalese since 2020, when Martinez came to MIT after earning a law degree from Harvard Law School. In a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/legal-writing-understanding-0307" target="_blank"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt;, Gibson, Martinez, and Mollica analyzed legal contracts totaling about 3.5 million words, comparing them with other types of writing, including movie scripts, newspaper articles, and academic papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That analysis revealed that legal documents frequently have long definitions inserted in the middle of sentences — a feature known as “center-embedding.” Linguists have previously found that this kind of structure can make text much more difficult to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Legalese somehow has developed this tendency to put structures inside other structures, in a way which is not typical of human languages,” Gibson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-study-lawyers-legalese-0529" target="_blank"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2023, the researchers found that legalese also makes documents more difficult for lawyers to understand. Lawyers tended to prefer plain English versions of documents, and they rated those versions to be just as enforceable as traditional legal documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lawyers also find legalese to be unwieldy and complicated,” Gibson says. “Lawyers don’t like it, laypeople don’t like it, so the point of this current paper was to try and figure out why they write documents this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had a couple of hypotheses for why legalese is so prevalent. One was the “copy and edit hypothesis,” which suggests that legal documents begin with a simple premise, and then additional information and definitions are inserted into already existing sentences, creating complex center-embedded clauses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thought it was plausible that what happens is you start with an initial draft that’s simple, and then later you think of all these other conditions that you want to include. And the idea is that once you’ve started, it’s much easier to center-embed that into the existing provision,” says Martinez, who is now a fellow and instructor at the University of Chicago Law School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the findings ended up pointing toward a different hypothesis, the so-called “magic spell hypothesis.” Just as magic spells are written with a distinctive style that sets them apart from everyday language, the convoluted style of legal language appears to signal a special kind of authority, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In English culture, if you want to write something that’s a magic spell, people know that the way to do that is you put a lot of old-fashioned rhymes in there. We think maybe center-embedding is signaling legalese in the same way,” Gibson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers asked about 200 non-lawyers (native speakers of English living in the United States, who were recruited through a crowdsourcing site called Prolific), to write two types of texts. In the first task, people were told to write laws prohibiting crimes such as drunk driving, burglary, arson, and drug trafficking. In the second task, they were asked to write stories about those crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the copy and edit hypothesis, half of the participants were asked to add additional information after they wrote their initial law or story. The researchers found that all of the subjects wrote laws with center-embedded clauses, regardless of whether they wrote the law all at once or were told to write a draft and then add to it later. And, when they wrote stories related to those laws, they wrote in much plainer English, regardless of whether they had to add information later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When writing laws, they did a lot of center-embedding regardless of whether or not they had to edit it or write it from scratch. And in that narrative text, they did not use center-embedding in either case,” Martinez says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another set of experiments, about 80 participants were asked to write laws, as well as descriptions that would explain those laws to visitors from another country. In these experiments, participants again used center-embedding for their laws, but not for the descriptions of those laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The origins of legalese&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson’s lab is now investigating the origins of center-embedding in legal documents. Early American laws were based on British law, so the researchers plan to analyze British laws to see if they feature the same kind of grammatical construction. And going back much farther, they plan to analyze whether center-embedding is found in the Hammurabi Code, the earliest known set of laws, which dates to around 1750 BC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There may be just a stylistic way of writing from back then, and if it was seen as successful, people would use that style in other languages,” Gibson says. “I would guess that it’s an accidental property of how the laws were written the first time, but we don’t know that yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that their work, which has identified specific aspects of legal language that make it more difficult to understand, will motivate lawmakers to try to make laws more comprehensible. Efforts to write legal documents in plainer language date to at least the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon declared that federal regulations should be written in “layman’s terms.” However, legal language has changed very little since that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have learned only very recently what it is that makes legal language so complicated, and therefore I am optimistic about being able to change it,” Gibson says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Some people think the world is wildly unpredictable, and are glad insurance can handle the risk and uncertainty they face. Other people believe their destiny is written in the stars, and consult a daily horoscope to reveal what is in store for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, Caley Horan has the history of these things covered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horan, an associate professor in MIT’s history program, studies multiple topics related to how we handle uncertainty in modern American life. Her award-winning first book, “Insurance Era,” published in 2021 by the University of Chicago Press, examined a deep tension: Insurance is a collective endeavor in certain respects but is defined in individual terms, at least by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized there was a story about insurance in the second half of the 20th century that people hadn’t really written,” Horan says. “It became important to me to tell that story, and to think about both the welfare state and private insurance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently Horan is in the midst of book project tackling another unwritten story: how astrology became a thoroughly modern, commercialized, and American pastime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might seem like quite a departure, but actually, Horan says, her history of astrology grew out of studying insurance history. The connecting tissue is how people themselves view uncertainty, risk, and the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The forms of astrology that evolved in the U.S. over the course of the 20th century turned away from chance, which insurance seeks to cover, and instead offered a theory of causation rooted in external natural phenomena,” Horan says. “The celestial bodies and movements of stars and planets are seen as determining forces, rather than the chance-based world of risk. This creates a clear sense of causation, and of time as cyclical rather than progressing. There’s a real appetite for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, Horan is uncovering how some familiar aspects of contemporary life have taken their current forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that everything has a history is what drew me to history as a field,” Horan says. “It’s tremendously important to have a sense of the past, and I find it endlessly interesting and exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her research and teaching, Horan was granted tenure at MIT last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An open field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horan, who grew up in Colorado, attended Stanford University, where she was a defender on the soccer team while completing a double major in history and feminist studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I settled on history because it seemed like a really open field,” Horan says. “You can study anything historically. If you want to study film, art, or if you want to study insurance or astrology, you can do so as a historian.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horan received her BA from Stanford in 2003, then attended graduate school at the University of Minnesota, where she settled on the history of insurance as her dissertation topic and earned her PhD in 2011. She joined the MIT faculty in 2015, while working to turn her thesis into her first book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In “Insurance Era,” Horan scrutinized high-level political dynamics as the private insurance industry sought to limit the New Deal-era expansion of the public safety net, which it regarded as a threat to its business. Horan also studied this with the lens of a cultural historian, looking at how industry advertising, for instance, portrays the decision to acquire insurance as a highly individualistic endeavor, a matter of personal prudence and savvy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately “Insurance Era” received critical acclaim, winning the 2022 Hagley Prize for the best book in business history, and it has just been published in a new paperback edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Astrology and the self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, Horan is researching and writing her history of astrology — or at least the modern American version of the practice. Earlier in America, what might be called “natural astrology” appeared in almanacs with forecasts about things like the best time to plant crops, as “part of an economy that had a very agrarian nature,” Horan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that economy changed, and so did astrology: Going back a bit more than century, astrology became focused on the self, and became a viable business all by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The astrology that we know today in the United States is very recent,” Horan says. “A lot of what we might today call the therapeutic nature of astrology, which is focused on the self and self-knowledge and self-understanding, is a late 19th-century development. By the 20th century, astrology becomes commercialized and part of a capitalist economy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspaper horoscope columns, for instance, date to 1930, along with the invention of “sun-sign” astrology, divided by birth dates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think modern astrology has offered people, and continues to offer people, an interpretive framework for understanding identity, self, and relationships to others,&amp;nbsp; at a time when matters of work and identity have been up for grabs,” Horan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her part, Horan’s own sense of identity as a historian is well-established, even as her work evolves: She will continue to pursue topics combining modern business, self-identity, uncertainty, and even health, studying those things in commercial and cultural terms. After she finishes her work on astrology in America, Horan intends to start writing about caregiver work, a growing part of the U.S. economy. And, she says, she continues to follow developments in insurance closely, with a return to that topic possible as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do feel some of the big-picture issues I have raised about insurance are very relevant,” Horan says. “That includes issues about the power we accord to private industry, how we think about collective organization, how Americans think about data and who controls their data, and how society distributes its resources, including basic insurance coverage. I think we’re heading into uncharted territory with some of these matters, and I do hope some of the questions I’ve raised continue to inform the way scholars are thinking about them.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Dean Agustín Rayo and the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences recently welcomed nine new professors to the MIT community. They arrive with diverse backgrounds and vast knowledge in their areas of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sonya Atalay&lt;/strong&gt; joins the Anthropology Section as a professor. She is a public anthropologist and archaeologist who studies Indigenous science protocols, practices, and research methods carried out with and for Indigenous communities. Atalay is the director and principal investigator of the Center for Braiding Indigenous Knowledges and Science, a newly established National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. She has expertise in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and served two terms on the National NAGPRA Review Committee, first appointed by the Bush administration and then for a second term by the Obama administration. Atalay has produced a series of research-based comics in partnership with Native nations about repatriation of Native American ancestral remains, return of sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony under NAGPRA law. Atalay earned her PhD in anthropology from the University of California at Berkeley (UC Berkeley).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anna Huang &lt;/strong&gt;SM ’08 joins the departments of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Music and Theater Arts as assistant professor. She will help develop graduate programming focused on music technology. Previously, she spent eight years with Magenta at Google Brain and DeepMind, spearheading efforts in generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and human-computer interaction to support human-AI partnerships in music-making. She is the creator of Music Transformer and Coconet (which powered the Bach Google Doodle). She was a judge and organizer for the AI Song Contest. Anna holds a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Mila, a BM in music composition, a BS in computer science from the University of Southern California, an MS from the MIT Media Lab, and a PhD from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elena Kempf&lt;/strong&gt; joins the History Section as an assistant professor. She is an historian of modern Europe with special interests in international law and modern Germany in its global context. Her current book project is a legal, political, and cultural history of weapons prohibitions in modern international law from the 1860s to the present. Before joining MIT, Kempf was a postdoc at the Miller Institute for Global Challenges and the Law at UC Berkeley and a lecturer at the Department of History at Stanford University. Elena earned her PhD in history from UC Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthias Michel &lt;/strong&gt;joins the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy as an assistant professor. Matthias completed his PhD in philosophy in 2019 at Sorbonne Université. Before coming to MIT, he was a Bersoff Faculty Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at New York University. His research is at the intersection between philosophy and cognitive science, and focuses on philosophical issues related to the scientific study of consciousness. His current work addresses questions such as how to distinguish entities with minds from those without, which animals are sentient, and which mental functions can be performed unconsciously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob Moscona&lt;/strong&gt; PhD ’21 is a new assistant professor in the Department of Economics. His research explores broad questions in economic development, with a focus on the role of innovation, the environment, and political economy. One stream of his research investigates the forces that drive the rate and direction of technological progress, as well as how new technologies shape global productivity differences and adaptation to major threats like climate change. Another stream of his research studies the political economy of economic development, with a focus on how variation in social organization and institutions affects patterns of conflict and cooperation. Prior to joining MIT, he was a Prize Fellow in Economics, History, and Politics at Harvard University. He received his BA from Harvard in 2016 and PhD from MIT in 2021. Outside of MIT, Jacob enjoys playing and performing music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sendhil Mullainathan&lt;/strong&gt; joins the departments of EECS and Economics as the Peter de Florez Professor. His research uses machine learning to understand complex problems in human behavior, social policy, and medicine. Previously, Mullainathan spent five years at MIT before joining the faculty at Harvard in 2004, and then the University of Chicago in 2018. He received his BA in computer science, mathematics, and economics from Cornell University and his PhD from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elise Newman&lt;/strong&gt; PhD ’21 is a new assistant professor in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy. Her forthcoming monograph, “When arguments merge,” studies the ingredients that languages use to construct verb phrases, and examines how those ingredients interact with other linguistic processes such as question formation. By studying these interactions, she forms a hypothesis about how different languages’ verb phrases can be distinct from each other, and what they must have in common, providing insight into this aspect of the human language faculty. In addition to the structural properties of language, Newman also has expertise in semantics (the study of meaning) and first language acquisition. She returns to MIT after a postdoc at the University of Edinburgh, after completing her PhD in linguistics at MIT in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oliver Rollins&lt;/strong&gt; joins the Program in Science, Technology, and Society as an assistant professor. He is a qualitative sociologist who explores the sociological dimensions of neuroscientific knowledge and technologies. His work primarily illustrates the way race, racialized discourses, and systemic practices of social difference impact and are shaped by the development and use of neuroscience. His book, “Conviction: The Making and Unmaking of The Violent Brain” (Stanford University Press, 2021), traces the evolution of neuroimaging research on antisocial behavior, stressing the limits of this controversial brain model when dealing with aspects of social inequality. Rollins’s second book project will grapple with the legacies of scientific racism in and through the mind and brain sciences, elucidating how the haunting presence of race endures through modern neuroscientific theories, data, and technologies. Rollins recently received an NSF CAREER Award to investigate the intersections between social justice and science. Through this project, he aims to examine the sociopolitical vulnerabilities, policy possibilities, and anti-racist promises for contemporary (neuro)science. Rollins received his PhD in sociology from the University of California at San Francisco. Before joining MIT, he held faculty positions at the University of Washington and the University of Louisville and was a postdoc in the University of Pennsylvania’s Program on Race, Science, and Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ishani Saraf&lt;/strong&gt; joins the Program in Science, Technology, and Society as an assistant professor. She is a sociocultural anthropologist. Her research studies the transformation and trade of discarded machines in translocal spaces in India and the Indian Ocean, where she focuses on questions of postcolonial capitalism, urban belonging, material practices, situated bodies of knowledge, and environmental governance. She received her PhD from the University of California at Davis, and prior to joining MIT, she was a postdoc and lecturer at the University of Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tristan Brown is the S.C. Fang Chinese Language and Culture Career Development Professor at MIT. He specializes in law, science, environment and religion of late imperial China, a period running from the 16th through early 20th centuries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this Q&amp;amp;A, Brown discusses how his areas of historical research can be useful for examining today’s pressing environmental challenges. This is part of an ongoing series exploring how the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences is addressing the climate crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why does this era of Chinese history resonate so much for you? How is it relevant to contemporary times and challenges?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;China has always been interesting to historians because it has a long-recorded history, with data showing how people have coped with environmental and climate changes over the centuries. We have tons of records of various kinds of ecological issues, environmental crises, and the associated outbreaks of calamities, famine, epidemics, and warfare. Historians of China have a lot to offer ongoing conversations about climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, I research conflicts over land and resources that erupted when China was undergoing huge environmental, economic, demographic, and political pressures, and the role that feng shui played as local communities and the state tried to mediate those conflicts. [Feng shui is an ancient Chinese practice combining cosmology, spatial aesthetics, and measurement to divine the right balance between the natural and built environment.]&amp;nbsp;Ultimately, the Qing (1644-1912) state was unable to manage these conflicts, and feng shui–based attempts to make decisions about conserving or exploiting certain areas blew up by the end of the 19th century in the face of pressures to industrialize. This is the subject of my first book, “&lt;a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691246734/laws-of-the-land"&gt;Laws of the Land: Fengshui and the State in Qing Dynasty China&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Can you give a sense of how feng shui was used to determine outcomes in environmental cases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;We tend to think of feng shui as a popular design mechanism today. While this isn’t completely inaccurate, there was much more to it than that in Chinese history, when it evolved over many centuries. Specifically, there are lots of insights in feng shui that reflect the ways in which people recorded the natural world, explained how components in the environment related to one another, and understood why and how bad things happened. There is an interesting concept in feng shui that your environment affects your health,and specifically your children’s (i.e., descendants and progeny) health. That concept is found across premodern feng shui literature and is one of fundamental principles of the whole knowledge system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the period I research, the Qing, the primary fuel energy sources in China came from timber and coal. There were legal cases where communities argued against efforts to mine a local mountain, saying that it could injure the feng shui (i.e., undermine the cosmological balance of natural forces and spatial integrity) of a mountain and hurt the fortunes of an entire region. People were suspicious of coal mining in their communities. They had seen or heard about mines collapsing and flooded mine shafts, they had watched runoff ruin good farmland, causing crops to fail, and even perhaps children to fall ill. Coal mining disturbed the human-earth connection, and thus the relationship between people and nature. People invoked feng shui to express an idea that the extraction of rocks and minerals from the land can have detrimental effects on living communities. Whether out of a sincere community-based concern or out of a more self-interested &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY" target="_blank"&gt;NIMBYism&lt;/a&gt;, feng shui was the primary discourse invoked in these cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all efforts to conserve areas from mining succeeded, especially as foreign imperialism encroached on China, threatening government and local control over the economy. It became gradually clear to China’s elites that the country had to industrialize to survive, and this involved the difficult and even violent process of taking people from farm work and bringing them to cities, building railways, cutting millions of trees, and mining coal to power it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;This makes it seem as if the Chinese swept away feng shui whenever it presented a hurdle, putting the country on the path to coal dependence, pollution, and a carbon-emitting future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Feng shui has not disappeared in China, but there’s no doubt about it that development in the form of industrialization took precedence in the 20th century, when it became officially labelled a “superstition” on the national stage. When I first went to China in 2007, city air was so polluted I couldn’t see the horizon. I was 18 years old and the air in some northern cities like Shijiazhuang honestly felt scary. I’ve returned many times since then, of course, and there has been great improvement in air quality, because the government made it a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feng shui is a future-oriented knowledge, concerned with identifying events that have happened in the past that are related to things happening today, and using that information to influence future events. As &lt;a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/richard-j-smith"&gt;Richard Smith&lt;/a&gt; of Rice University argues, Chinese have used history to order the past, ritual to order the present, and divination to order the future. Consider, for instance, Xiong’an, a new development area outside of Beijing that is physically marking the era of Xi Jinping’s tenure as paramount leader. As soon as the site was selected, people in China started talking about its feng shui, both out of potential environmental concerns and as a subtle form of political commentary. MIT’s own &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/andrew-stokols"&gt;Sol Andrew Stokols&lt;/a&gt; in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (DUSP) has a fantastic new dissertation examining that new area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the feng shui masters of old said there will be floods and droughts and bad stuff happening in the future if a course correction isn’t made. But at the same time, in feng shui there's never a situation that is hopeless; there is no lost cause. So, there is optimism in the knowledge and rhetoric of feng shui that I think might be applicable as time goes on with climate change. As long as you have a future, you can still change it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;In 2023, you were awarded one of the first grants of MIT’s Climate Nucleus, the faculty committee charged with seeing through the Institute’s climate action plan over the decade. What have you been up to courtesy of this fund?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Well, it all started years ago, when I started thinking about great number of mountains in China associated with Buddhism or Daoism that have become national parks in recent decades. Some of these mountains host trees and plant species that are not found in any other part of China. For my grant, I wanted to find out how these mountains have managed to incubate such rare species for the last 2,000 years. And it's not as simple as just saying, well, Buddhism, right?&amp;nbsp;Because there are plenty of Buddhist mountains that have not fared as well ecologically. The religious landscape is part of the answer, but there’s also all the messiness of material history that surrounds such a mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this grant, I am bringing together a group of scholars of religion, historians, as well as engineers working in conservation ecology, and we’re trying to figure out what makes some of these places religiously and environmentally distinctive. People come to the project with different approaches. My MIT colleague &lt;a href="https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/serguei-saavedra/"&gt;Serguei Saavedra&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering uses new models in system ecology to measure the resilience of environments under various stresses. My colleague in religious studies, &lt;a href="https://cris.tau.ac.il/en/persons/or-porath"&gt;Or Porath&lt;/a&gt; at Tel Aviv University, is asking when and how Asian religions have centered — or ignored — animals and animal welfare. Another collaboration with MIT’s &lt;a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/people/siqi-zheng"&gt;Siqi Zheng&lt;/a&gt; in DUSP and &lt;a href="https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/1480-wenchi-liao"&gt;Wen-Chi Liao&lt;/a&gt; at the National University of Singapore is looking at how we can use artificial intelligence, machine learning, and classical feng shui manuals to teach computers how to analyze the value of a property’s feng shui in Sinophone communities around the world. There’s a lot going on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How do you bring China’s unique environmental history and law into your classroom, and make it immediate and relevant to the world students face today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;History is always part of the answer. I mean, whether it’s for an economist, a political scientist, or an architect, history matters. Likewise, when you’re confronting climate change and all these struggles regarding the environment and various crises involving ecosystems, it’s always a good idea to look at how human beings in the past dealt with similar crises. It doesn’t give you a prediction on what would happen in the future, but it gives you some range of possibilities, many of which may at first appear counterintuitive or surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what the humanities do. My job is to make MIT undergraduates care about a people who are no longer alive, who walked the earth a thousand years ago, who confronted terrible times of conflict and hunger. Sometimes these people left behind a written record about their world, and sometimes they didn’t. But we try to hear them out regardless. I want students to develop empathy for these strangers and wonder what it would be like to walk in their shoes. Every one of those people is someone’s ancestor, and they very well could have been your ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my class 21H.186 (Nature and Environment in China), we look&amp;nbsp;at the historical precedents that might be useful for today’s environmental challenges, ranging from urban pollution or domestic recycling systems.&amp;nbsp;The fact we’re still here to ask historical questions is itself significant. When we feel despair about climate change, we can ask, “How did individuals endure the changed course of the Yellow River or the Little Ice Age?” Even when it is recording tragedies, history can be understood as an enduring form of hope.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Knight Science Journalism Program at MIT (KSJ) will welcome 12 fellows in August. In addition to 10 Academic-Year Fellows, KSJ welcomes the inaugural Fellow for Advancing Science Journalism in Africa and the Middle East, and co-hosts a Sharon Begley Fellow with Boston-based publication STAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The Knight Science Journalism Program, established at MIT in 1983, is the world’s leading science journalism fellowship program. Fellows come to Cambridge, Massachusetts, to explore science, technology, and the craft of journalism in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The class of 2025 represents the expansive media environment of today’s journalism. Together, the group has award-winning experience in a wide array of journalistic media, reaching the public through podcasts, documentaries, photographs, books, YouTube, TV, and radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“It is a privilege to welcome journalists to our programs who are so deeply aware of the importance of quality science coverage, who are eager to improve their craft, and who will continue to contribute positively to the public understanding of science once they leave here,” says Deborah Blum, KSJ director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The fellows will spend their time in Cambridge studying at MIT and other leading research universities in the Boston area. They’ll also attend seminars by leading scientists and storytellers, take part in hands-on classes and workshops, and visit world-renowned research laboratories. Each journalist will also pursue an independent research project, focused on a topic of their choice, that advances science journalism in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Many of the biggest headlines of our era derive from science and technology — and the way we apply it to the world around us,” says Blum. “Our fellowship program recognizes the&amp;nbsp;dedication and understanding required for stories that do justice to these issues. We bring fellows to MIT to provide them with an opportunity to enrich and deepen that understanding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabiana Cambricoli &lt;/strong&gt;is an award-winning Brazilian journalist based in São Paulo, working as a senior health correspondent for Estadão newspaper, with a focus on in-depth and investigative stories.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;MIT philosophy doctoral student Abe Mathew believes individual rights play an important role in protecting the autonomy we value. But he also thinks we risk serious dysfunction if we ignore the importance of supporting and helping others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We should also acknowledge another feature of our moral lives,” he says, “namely, our need for affinity or closeness with other human beings, and our continued reliance on them to live flourishing lives in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Philosophy can be an important tool in understanding how humans interact with one another, he says. “I study moral obligation and rights, how the two relate, and the role they have to play in how we relate to one another,” Mathew adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mathew asks that we think of autonomy and affinity as opposing forces — an idea he attributes to MIT philosopher, professor, and mentor&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://philosophy.mit.edu/setiya/"&gt;Kieran Setiya&lt;/a&gt;. Autonomy pushes people farther from us, and affinity pulls people closer, Mathew says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The dance between autonomy and affinity creates morality,” Mathew adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mathew is investigating one of moral philosophy’s foundational ideas — that every obligation we owe to another person correlates to a right that they have against us. The “Correlativity Thesis” is widely taken for granted, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“A common example that's used to motivate the Correlativity Thesis is a case of a promise,” Mathew explains. “If I promise to meet you for coffee at 11, then I have a moral obligation to meet you for coffee at 11, and you have a right to meet me at 11.” While Mathew believes this is how promising works, he doesn’t think the Correlativity Thesis is true across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“There isn’t necessarily a one-to-one relationship between rights and obligations,” he said. “A pregnant person on the bus may not have a right to your seat, but you do have an obligation to give it up for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We need folks’ help to do things”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Before coming to MIT, Mathew majored in philosophy and minored in ethics, law, and society as an undergraduate at the University of Toronto. Upon graduating in 2020, he was awarded the prestigious John Black Aird Scholarship, given each year to the university’s top undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Now at MIT, Mathew says his research is based on the value of shared responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We need folks’ help to do things,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When we lose sight of moral values, our societal connections can fall away, he argues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Mutual cooperation makes our lives possible,” Mathew says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;His research suggests alternatives to the idea that rights demand obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Morality puts a certain kind of pressure on us to ‘pay it forward’ — it requires us to do for others what was once done for us,” Mathew says. “If we don’t, we’re making an exception of ourselves; in essence, we're saying, ‘I was worthy of that help from others, but no one else is worthy of being helped by me.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mathew also values the notion of paying it forward because he’s seen its value in his life.&amp;nbsp;“I’ve encountered so many people who’ve gone above and beyond that I owe them,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A valuable social compact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mathew has been extensively involved in “public philosophy.” For example, he’s organized public events at MIT, like the successful “Ask a Philosopher Anything” panel in the Stata Center lobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mathew’s work leading the local chapter of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://corrupttheyouth.org/index.php/about/"&gt;Corrupt the Youth&lt;/a&gt;, a philosophy outreach program focused on&amp;nbsp;bringing philosophy to high schools students from historically marginalized groups, is an extension of his belief in our shared responsibility for one another — of “paying it forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The reason I discovered philosophy was because of my instructors in college who not only introduced me to the subject, but also cultivated my enthusiasm for it and mentored me,” he says. “Our moral theorizing should take into account the kinds of creatures we are: vulnerable human beings who are constantly in need of each other to get by in the world,” Mathew says. One aspect of our vulnerability is our tendency to make mistakes, and as a result, damage our relationships with one another. Morality, Mathew says, gives us a tool — the social practice of forgiving — through which we can coexist, repair relationships we damage, and lead our lives together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Mathew wants moral philosophers to consider their ideas’ practical, real-world applications. His experiences derive, in part, from notions of moral responsibility. Those who’ve been given a lot, he believes, have a greater responsibility for others.&amp;nbsp;These kinds of social systems can consistently be improved by paying good deeds forward, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Moral philosophy should help build a world that allows for our mutual benefit,” Mathew says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) recently organized and hosted a two-day symposium, The History of Technology: Past, Present, and Future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The symposium was held June 7-8 at MIT’s Wong Auditorium, and featured scholars from a variety of institutions with expertise in the history of technology. Each presented their ideas about the intersection of science, technology, and society, the field’s needs, and opportunities for its future development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We’re pleased to provide a venue in which these kinds of conversations can occur,” said Deborah Fitzgerald, STS program head and former dean of MIT’s School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The symposium opened with welcoming remarks from Fitzgerald and MIT Professor Merritt Roe Smith. Fitzgerald and Smith are both Leverett Howell and William King Cutten Professors of the History of Technology at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“These kinds of gatherings — of old friends and colleagues and several generations of&amp;nbsp;students — create new opportunities to advance scholarship, create connections, and keep abreast of what’s happening in the field,” Smith said. “Seeing the future through the lens of our shared pasts&amp;nbsp;adds an important perspective on current innovations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;More than 20 scholars made presentations during the symposium. The topics and speakers included:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;David Lucsko PhD ’05, professor of history at Auburn University:&amp;nbsp;“How Things Work and Why It Matters — or, Why Poring over Automotive Wiring Diagrams from the 1970s Isn’t Actually a Colossal Waste of Time;”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;Dave Unger, an independent public historian: “Tools for Imagining a Better World: Social Technology, Organizational Dark Matter, and Reading for Difference;”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;Gregory Clancey, associate professor at the National University of Singapore: “The History of Technology in an Age of Mass Extinction;” and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"&gt;Ruth Schwartz Cowan, professor emerita at the University of Pennsylvania: “Does the History of Technology have a Paradigm?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded>

        <dc:creator>Katherine Ouellette | Anne Wilson | MIT Open Learning | Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Two films produced by MIT were honored with Emmy nominations by the National Academy of Television Arts &amp;amp; Sciences Boston/New England Chapter. Both&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XgFo3VshSX0?si=sQOZ9yGvBkqXZpTj"&gt;We Are the Forest&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9SU6DyHAtQ"&gt;No Drop to Spare&lt;/a&gt;” illustrate international conversations the MIT community is having about the environment and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We Are the Forest,” produced by MIT Video Productions (MVP) at MIT Open Learning, was one of six nominees in the Education/Schools category. The documentary highlights the cultural and scientific exchange of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/festival-jazz-ensemble"&gt;MIT Festival Jazz Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-wind-ensemble"&gt;MIT Wind Ensemble&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mta.mit.edu/music/performance/mit-vocal-jazz-ensemble"&gt;MIT Vocal Jazz Ensemble&lt;/a&gt; in the Brazilian Amazon. The excursion depicted in the film was part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/hearing-amazonia-program-2023/"&gt;ongoing work&lt;/a&gt; of Frederick Harris Jr., MIT director of wind and jazz ensembles and senior lecturer in music, to combine Brazilian music and environmental research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“No Drop to Spare,” created by the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE), was nominated in the Environment/Science and Video Essayist categories. The film, produced by John Freidah, MechE senior producer and creative lead, follows a team of researchers from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.gear.mit.edu/"&gt;K. Lisa Yang Global Engineering and Research (GEAR) Center&lt;/a&gt; working in Kenya, Morocco, and Jordan to deploy affordable, user-driven smart irrigation technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We Are the Forest” tells the story of 80 MIT student musicians who traveled to Manaus, Brazil in March 2023. Together with Indigenous Brazilian musicians and activists, the students played music, created instruments with found objects from the rainforest, and connected their musical practice to nature and culture. The trip and the documentary culminated with the concert “Hearing Amazônia: Art and Resistance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“We have an amazing team who are excited to tell the stories of so many great things that happen at MIT,” says Clayton Hainsworth, director for MVP. “It’s a true pleasure when we get to partner with the Institute’s community on these video projects — from Fred [Harris], with his desire for outreach of the music curriculum, giving students new perspectives and getting beyond the lab; to students getting to experience the world and seeing how that affects their next steps as they go out and make an impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The documentary was produced by Hainsworth, directed by Jean Dunoyer, staff editor at MVP, and filmed by Myles Lowery, field production videographer at MVP. Hainsworth credits Dunoyer with refining the story’s main themes: the universality of music as a common human language, and the ways that Indigenous communities can teach and inform the rest of the globe about the environment and the challenges we are all facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“The film highlights the reach of how MIT touches the world and, more importantly, how the world touches MIT,” says Hainsworth, adding that&amp;nbsp;the work was generously supported by A. Neil Pappalardo ’64 and Jane Pappalardo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“No Drop to Spare” evoked a similar sentiment from Freidah. “What I liked about this story was the potential for great impact,” says Freidah, discussing the MechE film’s production process. “It was global, it was being piloted in three different places in the world, with three different end users, and had three different applications. You sort of go in with an idea in mind of what the story might be, then things bubble up. In this story, as with so many stories, what rose to the top was the students and the impact they were having on the real world and end users.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Freidah has worked with Amos Winter SM ’05, PhD ’11, associate professor of mechanical engineering and MIT GEAR Center principal investigator, to highlight other impact global projects in the past, including producing a video in 2016. That film, “&lt;a href="https://meche.mit.edu/news-media/video/0/1529"&gt;Water is Life&lt;/a&gt;,” explores the development of low-cost desalination systems in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;While the phrase “it’s an honor to be nominated” might seem cliched, it remains often used because the sentiment almost always rings true. Although neither film triumphed at this year’s awards ceremony, Freidah says there’s much to be celebrated in the final product.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;“Seeing the effect this piece had, and how it highlighted our students, that’s the success story — but it’s always nice also to receive recognition from outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The 47th Boston/New England Emmy Awards Ceremony took place on June 8 at the Marriott Boston Copley Place.

  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5b94b3da-7fff-600e-90cb-6b242bd0fbb3"&gt;In the beginning, as one version of the Haudenosaunee creation story has it, there was only water and sky. According to oral tradition, when the Sky Woman became pregnant, she dropped through a hole in the clouds. While many animals guided her descent as she fell, she eventually found a place on the turtle’s back. They worked together, with the aid of other water creatures, to lift the land from the depths of these primordial waters to create what we now know as our earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The new immersive experience,&amp;nbsp;“Ne:Kahwistará:ken Kanónhsa’kówa í:se Onkwehonwe,”&amp;nbsp;is a vivid retelling of this creation story by multimedia artist&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/projects/longhouse/"&gt;Jackson 2bears&lt;/a&gt;, also known as Tékeniyáhsen Ohkwá:ri (Kanien’kehà:ka), the&amp;nbsp;2022–24 Ida Ely Rubin Artist in Residence&amp;nbsp;at the &lt;a href="https://arts.mit.edu/cast/"&gt;MIT Center for Art, Science and Technology&lt;/a&gt;. “A lot of what drives my work is finding new ways to keep Haudenosaunee teachings and stories alive in our communities, finding new ways to tell them, but also helping with the transmission and transformation of those stories as they are for us, a living part of our cultural practice,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A virtual recreation of the traditional longhouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;2bears was first inspired to create a virtual reality version of a longhouse, a traditional Haudenosaunee structure, in collaboration with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.thruthereddoor.com/about-us/"&gt;Thru the RedDoor,&lt;/a&gt; an Indigenous-owned media company in Six Nations of the Grand River that 2bears calls home. The longhouse is not only a “functional dwelling,” says 2bears, but an important spiritual and cultural center where creation myths are shared. “While we were developing the project, we were told by one of our knowledge keepers in the community that longhouses aren’t structures, they’re not the materials they’re made out of,” 2bears recalls, “They’re about the people, the Haudenosaunee people. And it’s about our creative cultural practices in that space that make it a sacred place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The virtual recreation of the longhouse connects storytelling to the physical landscape, while also offering a shared space for community members to gather. In Haudenosaunee worldview, says 2bears, “stories are both durational, but they’re also dimensional.” With&amp;nbsp;“Ne:Kahwistará:ken Kanónhsa’kówa í:se Onkwehonwe,” the longhouse was brought to life with drumming, dancing, knowledge-sharing, and storytelling. The immersive experience was designed to be communal. “We wanted to develop a story that we could work on with a bunch of other people rather than just having a story writer or director,” 2bears says, “We didn’t want to do headsets. We wanted to do something where we could be together, which is part of the longhouse mentality,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The power of collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;2bears produced the project with the support of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cocreationstudio.mit.edu"&gt;Co-Creation Studio&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;at MIT’s &lt;a href="http://opendoclab.mit.edu/"&gt;Open Documentary Lab&lt;/a&gt;. “We think of co-creation as a dance, as a way of working that challenges the notion of the singular author, the single one point of view,” says documentarian Kat Cizek, the artistic director and&amp;nbsp;co-founder&amp;nbsp;of the studio, who began her work at MIT as a CAST visiting artist. “And Jackson does that. He does that within the community at Six Nations, but also with other communities and other Indigenous artists.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In an individualist society that so often centers the idea of the singular author, 2bears’s practice offers a powerful example of what it means to work as a collective, says Cizek. “It’s very hard to operate, I think, in any discipline without some level of collaboration,” she says, “What’s different about co-creation for us is that people enter the room with no set agenda. You come into the room and you come with questions and curiosity about what you might make together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2bears at MIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;At first, 2bears thought his time at MIT would help with the technical side of his work. But over time, he discovered a rich community at MIT, a place to explore the larger philosophical questions relating to technology, Indigenous knowledge, and artificial intelligence. “We think very often about not only human intelligence, but animal intelligence and the spirit of the sky and the trees and the grass and the living earth,” says 2bears, “and I’m seeing that kind of reflected here at the school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In 2023, 2bears participated in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2023/first-its-kind-indigenous-immersive-incubator-gathers-mit-campus-0519"&gt;Co-Creation Studio Indigenous Immersive Incubator&lt;/a&gt; at MIT, an historic gathering of 10 Indigenous artists, who toured MIT labs and met with Indigenous leaders from MIT and beyond. As part of the summit, he shared&amp;nbsp;“Ne:Kahwistará:ken Kanónhsa’kówa í:se Onkwehonwe”&amp;nbsp;as a work in progress. This spring, he presented the latest iteration of the work at MIT in smaller settings with groups of students, and in a large public lecture presented by CAST and the Art, Culture and Technology Program. His “experimental method of storytelling and communication really conveys the power of what it means to be a community as an Indigenous person, and the unique beauty of all of our people,” says Nicole McGaa, Oglala Lakota, co-president of MIT’s Native American Indigenous Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storytelling in 360 degrees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;2bear’s virtual recreation became even more important after the longhouse in the community unexpectedly burned down midway through the process, after the team had created 3D scans of the structure. With no building to project onto, they used ingenuity and creativity to pivot to the project’s current iteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The immersive experience was remarkable in its sheer size: 8-foot tall images played on a canvas screen 34 feet in diameter. With video mapping using multiple projectors and 14-channel surround sound, the story of Sky Woman coming down to Turtle Island was given an immense form. It premiered at the 2RO MEDIA Festival, and was met with an enthusiastic response from the Six Nations community. “It was so beautiful. You can look in any direction, and there was something happening,” says Gary Joseph, director of Thru the RedDoor. “It affects you in a way that you didn’t think you could be affected because you're seeing the things that are sacred to you being expressed in a way that you’ve never imagined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In the future, 2bears hopes to make the installation more interactive, so participants can engage with the experience in their own ways, creating multiple versions of the creation story. “I’ve been thinking about it as creating a living installation,” he says. “It really was a project made in community, and I couldn’t have been happier about how it turned out. And I’m really excited about where I see this project going in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>Exotic black holes could be a byproduct of dark matter</title>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For every kilogram of matter that we can see — from the computer on your desk to distant stars and galaxies — there are 5 kilograms of invisible matter that suffuse our surroundings. This “dark matter” is a mysterious entity that evades all forms of direct observation yet makes its presence felt through its invisible pull on visible objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, physicist Stephen Hawking offered one idea for what dark matter might be: a population of black holes, which might have formed very soon after the Big Bang. Such &lt;a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n11/david-kaiser/black-hole-flyby" target="_blank"&gt;“primordial” black holes&lt;/a&gt; would not have been the goliaths that we detect today, but rather microscopic regions of ultradense matter that would have formed in the first quintillionth of a second following the Big Bang and then collapsed and scattered across the cosmos, tugging on surrounding space-time in ways that could explain the dark matter that we know today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT physicists have found that this primordial process also would have produced some unexpected companions: even smaller black holes with unprecedented amounts of a nuclear-physics property known as “color charge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These smallest, “super-charged” black holes would have been an entirely new state of matter, which likely evaporated a fraction of a second after they spawned. Yet they could still have influenced a key cosmological transition: the time when the first atomic nuclei were forged. The physicists postulate that the color-charged black holes could have affected the balance of fusing nuclei, in a way that astronomers might someday detect with future measurements. Such an observation would point convincingly to primordial black holes as the root of all dark matter today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though these short-lived, exotic creatures are not around today, they could have affected cosmic history in ways that could show up in subtle signals today,” says David Kaiser, the&amp;nbsp;Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and professor of physics at MIT. “Within the idea that all dark matter could be accounted for by black holes, this gives us new things to look for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser and his co-author, MIT graduate student Elba Alonso-Monsalve, have &lt;a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.231402" target="_blank"&gt;published their study today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Physical Review Letters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A time before stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The black holes that we know and detect today are the product of stellar collapse, when the center of a massive star caves in on itself to form a region so dense that it can bend space-time such that anything — even light — gets trapped within. Such “astrophysical” black holes can be anywhere from a few times as massive as the sun to many billions of times more massive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Primordial” black holes, in contrast, can be much smaller and are thought to have formed in a time before stars. Before the universe had even cooked up the basic elements, let alone stars, scientists believe that pockets of ultradense, primordial matter could have accumulated and collapsed to form microscopic black holes that could have been so dense as to squeeze the mass of an asteroid into a region as small as a single atom. The gravitational pull from these tiny, invisible objects scattered throughout the universe could explain all the dark matter that we can’t see today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that were the case, then what would these primordial black holes have been made from? That’s the question Kaiser and Alonso-Monsalve took on with their new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have studied what the distribution of black hole masses would be during this early-universe production but never tied it to what kinds of stuff would have fallen into those black holes at the time when they were forming,” Kaiser explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super-charged rhinos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT physicists looked first through existing theories for the likely distribution of black hole masses as they were first forming in the early universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our realization was, there’s a direct correlation between when a primordial black hole forms and what mass it forms with,” Alonso-Monsalve says. “And that window of time is absurdly early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Kaiser calculated that primordial black holes must have formed within the first quintillionth of a second following the Big Bang. This flash of time would have produced “typical” microscopic black holes that were as massive as an asteroid and as small as an atom. It would have also yielded a small fraction of exponentially smaller black holes, with the mass of a rhinoceros and a size much smaller than a single proton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would these primordial black holes have been made from? For that, they looked to studies exploring the composition of the early universe, and specifically, to the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) — the study of how quarks and gluons interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarks and gluons are the fundamental building blocks of protons and neutrons — elementary particles that combined to forge the basic elements of the periodic table. Immediately following the Big Bang, physicists estimate, based on QCD, that the universe was an immensely hot plasma of quarks and gluons that then quickly cooled and combined to produce protons and neutrons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that, within the first quintillionth of a second, the universe would still have been a soup of free quarks and gluons that had yet to combine. Any black holes that formed in this time would have swallowed up the untethered particles, along with an exotic property known as “color charge” — a state of charge that only uncombined quarks and gluons carry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we figured out that these black holes form in a quark-gluon plasma, the most important thing we had to figure out was, how much color charge is contained in the blob of matter that will end up in a primordial black hole?” Alonso-Monsalve says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using QCD theory, they worked out the distribution of color charge that should have existed throughout the hot, early plasma. Then they compared that to the size of a region that would collapse to form a black hole in the first quintillionth of a second. It turns out there wouldn’t have been much color charge in most typical black holes at the time, as they would have formed by absorbing a huge number of regions that had a mix of charges, which would have ultimately added up to a “neutral” charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the smallest black holes would have been packed with color charge. In fact, they would have contained the maximum amount of any type of charge allowed for a black hole, according to the fundamental laws of physics. Whereas such “extremal” black holes have been hypothesized for decades, until now no one had discovered a realistic process by which such oddities actually could have formed in our universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Bernard Carr of Queen Mary University of London, an expert on the topic of primordial black holes who first worked on the topic with Stephen Hawking, describes the new work as “exciting.” Carr, who was not involved in the study, says the work “shows that there are circumstances in which a tiny fraction of the early universe can go into objects with an enormous amount of color charge (at least for a while), exponentially greater than what has been identified in previous studies of QCD.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The super-charged black holes would have quickly evaporated, but possibly only after the time when the first atomic nuclei began to form. Scientists estimate that this process started around one second after the Big Bang, which would have given extremal black holes plenty of time to disrupt the equilibrium conditions that would have prevailed when the first nuclei began to form. Such disturbances could potentially affect how those earliest nuclei formed, in ways that might some day be observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These objects might have left some exciting observational imprints,” Alonso-Monsalve muses. “They could have changed the balance of this versus that, and that’s the kind of thing that one can begin to wonder about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy. Alonso-Monsalve is also supported by a fellowship from the MIT Department of Physics.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <title>The unexpected origins of a modern finance tool</title>
  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2024/unexpected-origins-modern-finance-tool-discounting-0606</link>
  <description><![CDATA[Discounting calculations are ubiquitous today — thanks partly to the English clergy who spread them amid turmoil in the 1600s, an MIT scholar shows.]]></description>

        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>
  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early 1600s, the officials running Durham Cathedral, in England, had serious financial problems. Soaring prices had raised expenses. Most cathedral income came from renting land to tenant farmers, who had long leases so officials could not easily raise the rent. Instead, church leaders started charging periodic fees, but these often made tenants furious. And the 1600s, a time of religious schism, was not the moment to alienate church members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in 1626, Durham officials found a formula for fees that tenants would accept. If tenant farmers paid a fee equal to one year’s net value of the land, it earned them a seven-year lease. A fee equal to 7.75 years of net value earned a 21-year lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a form of discounting, the now-common technique for evaluating the present and future value of money by assuming a certain rate of return on that money. The Durham officials likely got their numbers from new books of discounting tables. Volumes like this had never existed before, but suddenly local church officials were applying the technique up and down England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As financial innovation stories go, this one is unusual. Normally, avant-garde financial tools might come from, well, the financial avant-garde — bankers, merchants, and investors hunting for short-term profits, not clergymen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people have assumed these very sophisticated calculations would have been implemented by hard-nosed capitalists, because really powerful calculations would allow you to get an economic edge and increase profits,” says MIT historian William Deringer, an expert in the deployment of quantitative reasoning in public life. “But that was not the primary or only driver in this situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deringer has published a new research article about this episode, “&lt;a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/728594" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Aecroid’s Tables: Economic Calculations and Social Customs in the Early Modern Countryside&lt;/a&gt;,” appearing in the current issue of the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Modern History&lt;/em&gt;. In it, he uses archival research to explore how the English clergy started using discounting, and where. And one other question: Why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter inflation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, discounting is a pervasive tool. A dollar in the present is worth more than a dollar a decade from now, since one can earn money investing it in the meantime. This concept heavily informs investment markets, corporate finance, and even the NFL draft (where trading this year’s picks yields a greater haul of future picks). As the historian William N. Goetzmann has written, the related idea of net present value “is the most important tool in modern finance.” But while discounting was known as far back as the mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (often called Fibonacci) in the 1200s, why were English clergy some of its most enthusiastic early adopters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer involves a global change in the 1500s: the “price revolution,” in which things began costing more, after a long period when prices had been constant. That is, inflation hit the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People up to that point lived with the expectation that prices would stay the same,” Deringer says. “The idea that prices changed in a systematic way was shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Durham Cathedral, inflation meant the organization had to pay more for goods while three-quarters of its revenues came from tenant rents, which were hard to alter. Many leases were complex, and some were locked in for a tenant’s lifetime. The Durham leaders did levy intermittent fees on tenants, but that led to angry responses and court cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, tenants had additional leverage against the Church of England: religious competition following the Reformation. England’s political and religious schisms would lead it to a midcentury civil war. Maybe some private landholders could drastically increase fees, but the church did not want to lose followers that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some individual landowners could be ruthlessly economic, but the church couldn’t, because it’s in the midst of incredible political and religious turmoil after the Reformation,” Deringer says. “The Church of England is in this precarious position. They’re walking a line between Catholics who don’t think there should have been a Reformation, and Puritans who don’t think there should be bishops. If they’re perceived to be hurting their flock, it would have real consequences. The church is trying to make the finances work but in a way that’s just barely tolerable to the tenants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter the books of discounting tables, which allowed local church leaders to finesse the finances. Essentially, discounting more carefully calibrated the upfront fees tenants would periodically pay. Church leaders could simply plug in the numbers as compromise solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this period, England’s first prominent discounting book with tables was published in 1613; its most enduring, Ambrose Acroyd’s “Table of Leasses and Interest,” dated to 1628-29. Acroyd was the bursar at Trinity College at Cambridge University, which as a landholder (and church-affiliated institution) faced the same issues concerning inflation and rent. Durham Cathedral began using off-the-shelf discounting formulas in 1626, resolving decades of localized disagreement as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performing fairness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discounting tables from books did not only work because the price was right. Once circulating clergy had popularized the notion throughout England, local leaders could justify using the books because others were doing it. The clergy were “performing fairness,” as Deringer puts it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Strict calculative rules assured tenants and courts that fines were reasonable, limiting landlords’ ability to maximize revenues,” Deringer writes in the new article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, local church leaders in England were using discounting for their own economic self-interest. It just wasn’t the largest short-term economic self-interest possible. And it was a sound strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In Durham they would fight with tenants every 20 years [in the 1500s] and come to a new deal, but eventually that evolves into these sophisticated mechanisms, the discounting tables,” Deringer adds. “And you get standardization. By about 1700, it seems like these procedures are used everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, as Deringer writes, “mathematical tables for setting fines were not so much instruments of a capitalist transformation as the linchpin holding together what remained of an older system of customary obligations stretched nearly to breaking by macroeconomic forces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once discounting was widely introduced, it never went away. Deringer’s &lt;em&gt;Journal of Modern History&lt;/em&gt; article is part of a larger book project he is currently pursuing, about discounting in many facets of modern life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deringer was able to piece together the history of discounting in 17th-century England thanks in part to archival clues. For instance, Durham University owns a 1686 discounting book self-described as an update to Acroyd’s work; that copy was owned by a Durham Cathedral administrator in the 1700s. Of the 11 existing copies of Acroyd’s work, two are at Canterbury Cathedral and Lincoln Cathedral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hints like that helped Deringer recognize that church leaders were very interested in discounting; his further research helped him see that this chapter in the history of discounting is not merely about finance; it also opens a new window into the turbulent 1600s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never expected to be researching church finances, I didn’t expect it to have anything to do with the countryside, landlord-tenant relationships, and tenant law,” Deringer says. “I was seeing this as an interesting example of a story about bottom-line economic calculation, and it wound up being more about this effort to use calculation to resolve social tensions.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To address the climate crisis, one must understand environmental history. MIT Professor Kate Brown’s research has typically focused on environmental catastrophes. More recently, Brown has been exploring a more hopeful topic: tiny gardens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brown is the Thomas M. Siebel Distinguished Professor in History of Science in the MIT Program in Science, Technology, and Society. In this Q&amp;amp;A, Brown discusses her research, and how she believes her current project could help put power into the hands of everyday people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is part of an ongoing series exploring how the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences is addressing the climate crisis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;You have created an unusual niche for yourself as an historian of environmental catastrophes. What drew you to such a dismal beat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Historians often study New York, Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, but if you go to these little towns that nobody's ever heard of, that's where you see the destruction in the wake of progress. This is likely because I grew up in a manufacturing town in the Midwestern Rust Belt, watching stores go bankrupt and houses sit empty. I became very interested in the people who were the last to turn off the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Did this interest in places devastated by technological and economic change eventually lead to your investigation of Chernobyl?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I first studied the health and environmental consequences of radioactive waste on communities near nuclear weapons facilities in the U.S. and Russia, and then decided to focus on the health and environmental impacts of fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear energy plant disaster.&amp;nbsp;After gaining access to the KGB records in Kiev, I realized that there was a Klondike of records describing what Soviet officials at the time called a “public health disaster.” People on the ground recognized the saturation of radioactivity into environments and food supplies not with any with sensitive devices, but by noticing the changes in ecologies and on human bodies. I documented how Moscow leaders historically and decades later engaged in a coverup, and that even international bodies charged with examining nuclear issues were reluctant to acknowledge this ongoing public health disaster due to liabilities in their own countries from the production and testing of nuclear weapons during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Why did you turn from detailed studies of what you call “modernist wastelands” to the subject of climate change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Journalists and scholars have worked hard in the last two decades to get people to understand the scope and the scale and the verisimilitude of climate change. And that’s great, but some of these catastrophic stories we tell don’t make people feel very safe or secure. They have a paralyzing effect on us. Climate change is one of many problems that are too big for any one person to tackle, or any one entity, whether it’s a huge nation like the United States or an international body like the U.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I thought I would start to work on something that is very small scale that puts action in the hands of just regular people to try to tell a more hopeful story. I am finishing a new book about working-class people who got pushed off their farms in the 19th century, and ended up in mega cities like London, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Washington D.C., find land on the periphery of the cities. They start digging, growing their own food, cooperating together. They basically recreated forms of the commons in cities. And in so doing, they generate the most productive agriculture in recorded history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What are some highlights of this extraordinary city-based food generation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;In Paris circa 1900, 5,000 urban farmers grew fruits and vegetables and fresh produce for 2 million Parisians with a surplus left over to sell to London. They would plant three to six crops a year on one tract of land using horse manure to heat up soils from below to push the season and grow spring crops in winter and summer crops in spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An agricultural economist looked at the inputs and the outputs from these Parisian farms. He found there was no comparison to the Green Revolution fields of the 1970s. These urban gardeners were producing far more per acre, with no petroleum-based fertilizers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;What is the connection between little gardens like these and the global climate crisis, where individuals can feel at loss facing the scale of the problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; You can think of a tiny city garden like a coral reef, where one little worm comes and builds its cave. And then another one attaches itself to the first, and so on.&amp;nbsp;Pretty soon you have a great coral reef with a platform to support hundreds of different species — a rich biodiversity. Tiny gardens work that way in cities, which is one reason cities are now surprising hotspots of biodiversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transforming urban green space into tiny gardens doesn’t take an act of God, the U.N., or the U.S. Congress to make a change. You could just go to your municipality and say, “Listen, right now we have a zoning code that says every time there's a new condo, you have to have one or two parking spaces, but we’d rather see one or two garden spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you don't want a garden, you’ll have a neighbor who does. So people are outside and they have their hands in the soil and then they start to exchange produce with one another. As they share carrots and zucchini, they exchange soil and human microbes as well. We know that when people share microbiomes, they get along better, have more in common. It comes as no surprise that humans have organized societies around shaking hands, kissing on the cheek, producing food together and sharing meals. That’s what I think we've lost in our remote worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;So can we address or mitigate the impacts of climate change on a community-by-community basis?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;I believe that’s probably the best way to do it. When we think of energy we often imagine deposits of oil or gas, but, as our grad student Turner Adornetto points out, every environment has energy running through it.&amp;nbsp;Every environment has its own best solution. If it’s a community that lives along a river, tap into hydropower; or if it’s a community that has tons of organic waste, maybe you want to use microbial power; and if it’s a community that has lots of sun then use different kinds of solar power. The legacy of midcentury modernism is that engineers came up with one-size-fits-all solutions to plug in anywhere in the world, regardless of local culture, traditions, or environment. That is one of the problems that has gotten us into this fix in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politically, it’s a good idea to avoid making people feel they’re being pushed around by one set of codes, one set of laws in terms of coming up with solutions that work. There are ways of deriving energy and nutrients that enrich the environment, ways that don’t drain and deplete. You see that so clearly with a plant, which just does nothing but grow and contribute and give, whether it’s in life or in death. It’s just constantly improving its environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;How do you unleash creativity and propagate widespread local responses to climate change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the important things we are trying to accomplish in the humanities is communicating in the most down-to-earth ways possible to our students and the public so that anybody — from a fourth grader to a retired person — can get engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s “TECHNOLOGY” in uppercase letters, the kind that is invented and patented in places like MIT. And then there’s technology in lowercase letters, where people are working with things readily at hand. That is the kind of creativity we don’t often pay enough attention to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that at the end of the 19th century, scientists were sure that the earth was cooling and the earth would all under ice by 2020. In the 1950s, many people feared nuclear warfare. In the 1960s the threat was the “population bomb.” Every generation seems to have its apocalyptic sense of doom. It is helpful to take climate change and the Anthropocene and put them in perspective. These are problems we can solve.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Eleven MIT undergraduates, graduate students, and alumni have won Fulbright grants to embark on projects overseas in the 2024-25 grant cycle. Two other students were offered awards but declined them to pursue other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funded by the U.S. Department of State, the Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers year-long opportunities for American citizen students and recent alumni to conduct independent research, pursue graduate studies, or teach English in over 140 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT has been a Fulbright Top-Producing Institution for five years in a row. MIT students and alumni interested in applying to the Fulbright U.S. Student Program should contact Julia Mongo, MIT Fulbright program advisor, in the Office of Distinguished Fellowships in Career Advising and Professional Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April Cheng&lt;/strong&gt; is a junior studying physics with a minor in mathematics and is fast-tracked to graduate this spring. They will take their Fulbright research grant to the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany, where they will study different statistical techniques to infer the expansion rate of the universe from gravitational waves. They first developed an interest in gravitational waves and black holes at the MIT LIGO and Caltech LIGO labs, but their research spans a wide range of topics in astrophysics, including cosmology and fast radio bursts. Cheng is passionate about physics education and is heavily involved in developing educational materials for high school Science Olympiads. At MIT, they are a member of the Physics Values Committee, the physics mentorship program, and the MIT Lion Dance team. After Fulbright, Cheng will pursue a PhD in astrophysics at Princeton University, where they have received the President’s Fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace McMillan&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior majoring in literature and mechanical engineering with a concentration in Russian language. As a Fulbright English Teaching Assistant Award recipient, she will teach at a university in Kazakhstan. McMillan’s interest in Central Asia was sparked by a Russian language immersion program she participated in during her sophomore summer in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, funded by MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI). She is excited to help her students learn English to foster integration into the global academic community. During her time at MIT, McMillan has conducted research with faculty in nuclear science; earth, atmospheric, and planetary sciences; and the Digital Humanities Lab. Outside of academics, she has been an active member of her sorority, Sigma Kappa, and has served on the MIT Health Consumers’ Advisory Council for two years. After Fulbright, McMillan hopes to attend law school, focusing on education reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ryan McTigue&lt;/strong&gt; will graduate this spring with a BS in physics and mathematics and a concentration in Spanish. With a Fulbright award to Spain, he will do research at the University of Valencia’s Institute of Molecular Science focusing on the physics of two-dimensional multiferroic nanodevices. He is looking forward to improving his Spanish and getting the opportunity to live abroad. At MIT, McTigue became interested in condensed matter physics research with the Checkelsky group, where he focused on engineering materials with flat bands that exhibited correlated electron effects. Outside of research, McTigue has been a mentor in the physics department’s mentoring program and a member of the heavyweight men’s crew team. After his Fulbright grant, McTigue will begin a PhD in physics at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Murray ’22&lt;/strong&gt; graduated from MIT with a BS in computation and cognition and linguistics and philosophy. He will receive his MEng degree in computation and cognition this spring. As a Fulbright Hungary research grantee at the HUN-REN Wigner Research Centre for Physics, Murray will design generative AI models inspired by the primary visual cortex with the goal of making AI models more interpretable. At MIT, Murray’s research experiences spanned from training mice to perform navigation tasks in virtual reality to theorizing about how neurons might compute modular arithmetic. He was also a member of the men’s heavyweight crew team and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. After Fulbright, Murray will pursue a PhD in neuroscience at Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maaya Prasad ’22&lt;/strong&gt; completed her undergraduate education at MIT with degrees in both electrical engineering and creative writing and will graduate this month with an MS in mechanical and ocean engineering. Her thesis research focuses on microplastic detection using optical sensing. Prasad’s Fulbright fellowship will take her to Mauritius, an East African island country located in the Indian Ocean. Here, she will continue her master’s research at the University of Mauritius and will work with local researchers to implement a microplastic survey system. While at MIT, Prasad joined the varsity sailing team with no prior experience. Her time spent on the water led her to pursue marine research at MIT Sea Grant, and she eventually earned an honorable mention to the 2023 All-American Sailing Team. After Fulbright, Prasad hopes to pursue a PhD in applied ocean engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anusha Puri&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior majoring in biological engineering. Her Fulbright award will take her to Lausanne, Switzerland, where she will conduct cancer immunology research at the Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research. At MIT, Puri’s work in the Weinberg Lab focused on understanding mechanisms that drive resistance of breast cancer to immunotherapy. On campus, she founded and serves as president of MIT’s premiere stand-up comedy group, Stand-Up CoMITy, leads MIT’s Bhangra dance team, and is the editor-in-chief of the &lt;em&gt;MIT Undergraduate Research Journal&lt;/em&gt;. She looks forward to engaging with teaching outreach and practicing her French in Switzerland. After her Fulbright grant, she plans to pursue a PhD in biomedical science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivia Rosenstein&lt;/strong&gt; will graduate this spring with a BS in physics and a minor in French. Her Fulbright will take her to ENS Paris-Saclay in Palaiseau, France, where she’ll deepen her education in atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics. At MIT, Rosenstein has worked in Professor Mark Vogelsberger’s group researching models of galaxy formation and the early universe, and in Professor Richard Fletcher’s group on an erbium-lithium experiment to investigate quantum many-body dynamics in a degenerate mixture. In France, she will expand on the skills she developed in Fletcher’s lab by contributing to a project using optical tweezer arrays to study dipolar interactions. After Fulbright, Rosenstein plans to return to the United States to pursue a PhD in experimental AMO at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Schug&lt;/strong&gt;willreceive this spring an MEng degree in the Climate, Environment, and Sustainability track within the MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. During her Fulbright year in Italy, she will conduct research on carbon storage in the Venice lagoon at the University of Padua. Schug is excited to build upon her research with the Terrer Lab at MIT, where she is currently investigating the effectiveness of forestation as a carbon sequestration strategy. She also looks forward to improving her Italian language skills and learning about Italian history and culture. Before beginning Fulbright this fall, Schug will study ecological preservation in Sicily this summer through an MIT-Italy collaboration with the University of Catania. After Fulbright, she hopes to continue researching nature-based solutions as climate change mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaibhavi Shah ’21&lt;/strong&gt; earned a BS in biological engineering and in science, technology, and society at MIT, where she was named a Goldwater Scholar. She is now a medical student at Stanford University. As a Fulbright-Fogarty Fellow in Public Health, Shah will use both her computational and humanities backgrounds to investigate sociocultural factors underlying traumatic surgical injuries in Nepal. While at MIT, she was on the executive board of GlobeMed and the Society of Women Engineers, and she hopes to use those experiences to amplify diverse voices in medicine while on her journey to becoming a neurosurgeon-scientist. After Fulbright, Shah will complete her final year of medical school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charvi Sharma&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior studying computer science and molecular biology with a minor in theater arts. As a Fulbright English teaching assistant in Spain, she is excited to engage in cross-cultural exchange while furthering her skills as a teacher and as a leader. In addition to teaching, Sharma looks forward to immersing herself in the country’s vibrant traditions, improving her Spanish proficiency, and delving into the local arts and dance scene. At MIT, through Global Teaching Labs Spain and her roles as a dynaMIT mentor, an associate advisor, and a captain and president of her dance teams Mirchi and Nritya, Sharma has served as a teacher of both STEM and dance. Her passion for making a difference in her community is also evident through her work with Boston Medical Center’s Autism Program through the PKG Public Service Center and as an undergraduate cancer researcher in the Yaffe Lab. After Fulbright, Sharma plans to pursue an MD and, ultimately, a career as a clinician-scientist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isabella Witham&lt;/strong&gt; is a senior majoring in biological engineering. As a recipient of the Fulbright U.S.-Korea Presidential STEM Initiative Award, she will conduct research at Seoul National University’s Biomimetic Materials and Stem Cell Engineering Lab. Her work will involve creating biomimetic scaffolds for pancreatic cell transplantation to treat type I diabetes. While in South Korea, Witham aims to improve her language skills and explore cultural sites and cities. At MIT, she worked in the Belcher Lab on nanoparticle formulations, was a tutor for MIT’s Women’s Technology Program, and volunteered as a Medlink. After her Fulbright fellowship, she plans to pursue a PhD in biological engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
