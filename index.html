                  This is a website of my personal selection of RSS feeds from MIT that I find interesting. It  also provides access
                  to various news, research, and events from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
                </p>
                <p class="card-text bg-light bg-gradient">
                  I aim for this website to  be able to share these feeds in a user-friendly format, allowing users to quickly browse and find the
                  information that I found compelling. I hope you find these feeds as interesting a I have. On this page you will find feeds about various
                  topics such as Cancer Research, Climate Change, Space and Astronomy, etc. I chose Cancer Research because I did not know a lot about it
                  and I wanted other people who were interested in learning more to have an outlet to learn about it. Climate Change is something I have always
                  had an interest in, in my middle school I watched a documentary about Greta Thunberg and knew climate change was a bigger issue than I had
                  thought previously. I hope that this feed will help to educate on this serious issue. I have for a long time now been interested in learning other
                  cultures as to be more respectful. In the current world we live in respecting others cultures and religion has become something
                  others rarely do, I hope however that this page assists you in learning cultures and being respectful to them. Lastly I chose Space
                  because as far back as I can remember I have always been interested in space. The infinite ever growing void of space has always
                  fascinated me. I often watch Space documentaries or Neil deGrasse Tyson podcasts or videos. The idea of life on other planets is very
                  interesting to me, I hope you are able to share the same fasciation as me.

                  My name is Malaki Carstens, I am a 19 year old college student attending Ranken Technical College.
                  I have also attended 2 ID Tech camps at ages 12-13, and even took a coding elective at my middle school.
                  I have had an interest in coding for quite some time now, and I've enjoyed coding ever since.
